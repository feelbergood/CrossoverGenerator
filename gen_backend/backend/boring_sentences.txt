He yawned.
He stared back.
He gazed ahead.
He started dozing off.
He blinked slowly.
He blinked.
The sun shone.
The wind blew.
He had fun.
He felt nervous.
He felt happy.
He felt bored.
It was quiet.
He nodded.
He shrugged.
He looked to the side.
He frowned.
He smiled.
He paused for a bit.
He stood there and stared.
He breathed, his chest filling and emptying.
He looked around.
The climate is mild and relaxing and the rainfall averages about 40 in.
"Okay," she said in a sleepy voice.
He felt really sleepy.
It was a cold day.
It was a rainy day.
It was a bright day.
The sun was setting.
The sun was rising.
The wind blew.
He ate an apple.
He grimaced.
He turned around.
He looked lost.
He stopped listening.
Tick tock, tick tock; the clock kept ticking.
Time flowed like cement.
A minute had passed since he last checked an hour ago, or so it seemed.
Sitting there with nothing to stare at.
It was all pointless.
He didn't care.
He stopped caring.
It helped to pass the time.
He paced from side to side, his steps slowing down.
He sat down, bored.
He kicked lazily.
The day stretched before him.
He realized he couldn't fast-forward time.
The only thing alive in here is the ticking clock. The rest of them died some time ago.
Her foot tapped rhythmically up and down, her cheeks felt tight.
His mind felt comfortably blank.
Nothing registered in his mind.
He tapped his foot repetitively.
He glanced at the clock for the hundredth time.
Everything was quiet, save for the wind in the trees.
He heard tapping; it was just his foot on the pavement, moving impatiently.
His eyelids felt heavy.
Sleep comes like the falling of an axe.
Here in the soft sunlit afternoon sleep hung like a cloud.
The quiet days were idled away.
His eyes are steady to the horizon, face aglow with the last orange rays.
He felt a peace and mental calmness he could ever found before.
Unaware of her own heart beating or the rise and fall of her chest, she drifted into semi-consciousness.
In moments she is asleep, body relaxed, breathing steadily.
As each limb becomes heavy and my heart slows to a more peaceful beat, the comfort of bed calls.
She was the first to yawn.
Before his head reaches his pillow, his eyes softly close and his body becomes floppy.
The lazy wind pushes against the unmown grass.
He took a long exhale.

A rose by any other name would smell as sweet.
Diamond in the rough.
Going bananas!
Easy as pie.
Cold as ice.
Take a chill pill.
Don't judge a book by its cover.
Light as a feather.
Happily ever after.
When pigs fly!
All that glitters is not gold.
Avoid it like the plague.
Dead as a doornail.
Take the tiger by the tail.
Low hanging fruit
If only walls could talk...
The pot calling the kettle black!
Think outside the box.
Thick as thieves!
But at the end of the day...
Plenty of fish in the sea!
Every dog has its day.
Like a kid in a candy store!
Actions speak louder than words.
The grass is always greener on the other side.
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
You can't judge a book by its cover.
You can't please everyone.
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
Love is blind.
Ignorance is bliss.
There's no time like the present.
Better safe than sorry.
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
A blast from the past!
A bull in a china shop.
A chain is only as strong as its weakest link.
A chip off the old block.
A diamond in the rough.
A diamond is forever.
A drop in the bucket.
A face only a mother could love!
A fate worse than death.
A fish out of water.
A friend in need is a friend indeed.
A good beginning makes a good ending!
A jack of all trades and a master of none.
A journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step.
A knight in shining armor!
A leopard doesn't change its spots.
A little bird told me...
A little knowledge is a dangerous thing.
A mind is a terrible thing to waste.
A penny saved is a penny earned.
A picture's worth a thousand words.
A shot in the dark.
A sight for sore eyes!
A sorry sight...
A spoon full of sugar helps the medicine go down!
A stitch in time saves nine.
Only a stone's throw away.
A taste of his own medicine!
A watched pot never boils.
A wolf in sheep's clothing.
A woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle.
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
Actions speak louder than words.
Ah, to be young and foolish.
All bent out of shape.
All bets are off!
All dressed up and nowhere to go.
All for one, and one for all.
All hands on deck.
All hands to the pump.
All hell breaks loose.
All in a day's work.
All in due time.
All roads lead to Rome.
All talk and no action.
All that glitters is not gold.
All that jazz!
All the world's a stage.
All work and no play, makes Jack a dull boy.
All's fair in love and war.
All's well that ends well.
Already got one paw on the chicken coop.
Alrighty then!
Altitude is determined by attitude.
Always a bridesmaid, never the bride.
Always look on the bright side.
Am I my brother's keeper?
An apple a day keeps the doctor away.
An idle mind is the devil's playground.
An oldie, but a goodie.
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
Another day, another dollar.
Another nail in the coffin.
Any friend of yours is a friend of mine.
Are you a man or a mouse?
As alike as two peas in a pod.
As beautiful as the day is long.
As brown as a berry.
As busy as a bee.
As cool as a cucumber.
As dense as a London fog.
As easy as pie.
As far as the eye can see.
As fine as frog's hair.
As good as gold.
As happy as a clam.
As happy as a sandboy.
As happy as Larry.
As honest as the day is long.
As if!
As keen as mustard.
As luck would have it...
As plain as the nose on your face.
As snug as a bug in a rug!
As the crow flies!
As useful as a lead balloon.
As welcome as a skunk at a lawn party.
As ye sow, so shall ye reap.
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
Ask me no questions and I'll tell you no lies.
...at the crack of dawn.
...at the drop of a hat.
...at the eleventh (11th) hour.
...at the end of my rope / tether.
At the end of the day...
At the last minute...
Banging your head against a brick wall.
Barking up the wrong tree.
Be afraid, be very afraid.
Be still, my beating heart.
Be there or be square.
Beauty is a fading flower.
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
Beauty is only skin deep.
Better light a candle than curse the darkness.
Better the Devil you know than the Devil you don't.
Better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.
Better to remain silent and be thought a fool that to speak and remove all doubt.
Birds of a feather flock together.
Blood is thicker than water.
Born with a silver spoon in his mouth.
Can't have your cake and eat it too!
Can't teach an old dog new tricks!
Cat got your tongue?
Cut to the chase!
Cut your losses!
Damned if you do, and damned if you don't.
Don't be a party pooper.
Don't be a stick in the mud.
Don't bite off more than you can chew.
Don't bite the hand that feeds you.
Don't burn your bridges.
What you see is what you get.
Whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
Whatever floats your boat.
Whatever tickles your fancy.
Whatever turns you on.
When all is said and done...
When hell freezes over!
When in Rome, do as Romans do.
When it rains, it pours.
When life gives you lemons, make lemonade!
When pigs fly!
When push comes to shove.
When the cat's away, the mouse will play!
When the going gets tough, the tough get going.
When you lie with dogs, you catch fleas.
Where do you draw the line?
Where there's smoke, there's fire.
Things are not always as they seem.
Things aren't what they used to be.
Think outside the box!
Thinking with the wrong head!
Third time's a charm.
This could be the start of something big!
Time flies when you're having fun!
Time heals all wounds.
Time is money.
Time is of the essence.
One man's trash is another man's treasure.
Patience is a virtue.
More than meets the eye.
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.
If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.

It took two years to move on from the horrors that happen to the people that she loved until she looked through some old albums of her friends in her hometown Forks, Washington (La Push reservation more specially) and decided to go move back home across America her home town and start fresh where her favorite uncle Charlie lives not realizing it\'s going to change everything in her life, enrolled herself and her children into school, got herself a job or two and build a mini town inside her property only for herself and the ones she considers as family to get away from the paparazzi, the memories and most of the horrors of the war but, won\'t be going alone.Her oldest siblings Jay Granger with his children, Ariel and her husband George Weasley with their children, Fred and his two children, Charlie Weasley, Draco Malfoy and his wife Luna Malfoy \'nee Lovegood with their children, Blaise Zabini and his husband Neville Longbottom-Zabini with their children, Remus, Tonks and their son Teddy, Andromeda Tonks, Lucius and his wife Narcissa Malfoy, Theo & Pansy with their children are coming along by living in a manor called the \'Black Pearl\' and planning to work around the property by building houses, a mini mall, a park that is full of spots both muggle and wizarding, building a new orphanage for the children to have their own bedrooms, food, drinks etc. and let\'s not forget a Quidditch Pitch Field for everyone to play.

Jealous much? What will happen next? Well I don\'t know for sure yet but, we\'ll have to wait and see, don\'t we? Let me know what you guys think?Chapter One: Saying Goodbye to Old MemoriesHermione Potter \'nee Granger walked through the now deserted household of her childhood home with her family. It looks so empty without the lives that use to live in this house. The lives that has been taken away by the hand of Bellatrix Lestrange husband Rodolphus Lestrange and the death eaters that was after her and her two best friends Harry Potter and Ron Weasley. After learning what happen to her parents Dan & Emma Granger; Jay, Ariel and Hermione Granger were quite devastated, the only ones in her family are her brother Jay, her sister Ariel being her only family left besides their uncle Charlie and their estrange cousin Isabella as she prefers as \'Bella\' but, ignored her whining and protest by calling her Isabella just to spit her. She mentally shivered at the memory of the death of her parents.It was one of the worst experience of her life luckily. She called for help that Jay and Ariel managed to kill most of the death eaters as they tried to rescue their parents but, it was too late because Greyback a werewolf bitten her parents that left them to die a slowly death. The damage was done\xe2\x80\xa6. As soon as the memory entered her head she blocked it out. It was one of those things that Hermione had learnt to stop people from entering her mind, yet now she\'s used to it as a coping mechanism and hates when unwanted visitors from trying to read or enter her mind without her permission.After the war ended, Hermione busied herself with work while balancing planning her wedding for the 2nd time\xe2\x80\x94the happiest day of her life with everyone she cared about. Her parents, her uncle Charlie, her uncle Billy, uncle Harry, and auntie Sue with their children were invited the only person who wasn\'t invited in her family at the time was her estranged cousin Isabella and her aunt Renee as she stopped contacting with either of them as she didn\'t need or want any drama to ruin Harry and Hermione\'s wedding day.At first when Ron learned the truth about his two best friends Harry and Hermione are now dating as they kept their relationship as a secret for nearly a year until the summer before they reached their 6th year in Hogwarts before they decided to announced their relationship to Ron they were by themselves to talk, at first they both thought that Ron would accuse them for betraying them but, in their surprise he\'s ecstatic for his two best friends and felt relieved over the whole thing.[short flashback before Hermione\'s 6th year in Hogwarts] \xe2\x80\xa6"Ron\xe2\x80\xa6. here\'s something that Mione and I have to tell you\xe2\x80\xa6" Harry stated as they were talking among themselves alone "And it\'s really important," he explained."Oh yeah?" Ron noticed the tone of voice of Harry\'s "And there\'s something I need to tell you guys too," he announced."You first?" Hermione asked looking a bit anxious and nervous."No, you guys go first since you\'re the one that insisted we talk by ourselves Mione?" Ron pointed out.Hermione and Harry both looked at each other "Well\xe2\x80\xa6 okay\xe2\x80\xa6 see Harry and I \xe2\x80\xa6 we\'re dating\xe2\x80\xa6" she whispered."Your WHAT?!""Ron let us expl\xe2\x80\x94" Hermione was about to explain but, was cut off by Ron."Oh, thank bloody Merlin," Ron sighed in relief turning to Harry "Mate I thought you told me that you guys were dating in the second half of 4th year what happen to that,""Wait, you mean you\'re not angry," Hermione began to say causing Ron to look at her oddly then started to laugh at this causing them to gawk at him causing Hermione to feel a bit offended "I don\'t see what\'s so funny Ronald, I\'m trying to be serious here\xe2\x80\xa6 Harry and I are really dating as a couple\xe2\x80\xa6 boyfriend and girlfriend kind of thing""I know what it means Mione," Ron huffed at this as he stopped laughing "I\'m sorry I didn\'t mean to laugh it\'s just\xe2\x80\xa6 why would I be angry over this? It\'s not like I\'m against you guys being together just because you two are together you\'d think I\'d be angry and feel betrayed me or something?""Sorry... I just... find this hard to believe never mind," Hermione stared at him for a moment "So\xe2\x80\xa6 you really aren\'t angry\xe2\x80\xa6 what brought this on?""Is it that hard to believe that I can\'t be happy for my two best friends. Do you want me to be angry over this Mione?""No of course not.. I just...you really not angry with us?""Not even close we\'re still best friends Mione?""You really grown up \xe2\x80\xa6 Ron I\'m so proud,""Gee thanks,""I meant as a good thing\xe2\x80\xa6 after what happen last year\xe2\x80\xa6 I don\'t know\xe2\x80\xa6 I guess.. I didn\'t realize we\'re growing up as much as I thought\xe2\x80\xa6" Hermione shrugged at this "Are you sure\xe2\x80\xa6?""Mione listen to me okay because this is important," Ron began to say looking at Hermione with a serious look "I\'m fine you don\'t need to worry over this okay," he explained."Okay\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s just I was really worried\xe2\x80\xa6 because everyone kept stating that we belong together because of how we argue like a married couple and no offense Ron but, you\'re not exactly my type\xe2\x80\xa6 you\'re \xe2\x80\xa6 you\'re like a brother to me\xe2\x80\xa6"Ron stared at Hermione then at Harry who chuckled, then gave a sheepishly shrug and felt so relieved until he realize something "I know but, we been through so much and after everything we all deserve to be happy and now I know I seem to overreact over little things\xe2\x80\xa6 that would make me angry but, in the end of the day or mean that I wouldn\'t be happy for you guys being my best friends. You really think I would betray you come on Mione you know me better than that,"Hermione nodded to herself "Your right\xe2\x80\xa6 I guess\xe2\x80\xa6 I was just worried\xe2\x80\xa6 you can never know who to trust these days and \xe2\x80\xa6 we wanted to be absolutely sure that you\'re okay with this that\'s all I guess you outgrew being an emotional range of a teaspoon this year huh?""Ha, ha, ha, ha very funny," Ron sarcasailly began to say causing Harry and Hermione to chuckle leaving them to laugh after a few minutes "But, seriously though I\'m really happy for you guys,""Thanks Ron that really means a lot really thanks mate,""Not a problem.""So\xe2\x80\xa6 you\'re really not angry\xe2\x80\xa6 at us,""Yes Mione I\'m fine with it,""Mia he said he\'s not mad at us. I told you we can always count on Ron on anything so there\'s nothing to worry about,"Hermione sighed tiredly "Okay\xe2\x80\xa6 okay so I\'m over worried over nothing.. It\'s not like I can help myself\xe2\x80\xa6 I was just worried\xe2\x80\xa6 I didn\'t want to lose you guys as my best friends ya know,""Even after we grow old together and die together nothing will tear us apart we\'re best friends till the end Mione,""Awe that\'s kind of sweet thanks Ron for being supportive,""What are best friends are for Mione since it doesn\'t make sense that we\'d be together though I know we argue over stuff but, that doesn\'t mean we\'d belong together or whatever besides\xe2\x80\xa6 I\'m actually seeing someone,""Really that\'s great," Hermione beamed then realize something looking up at Ron "Hold on \xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s not\xe2\x80\xa6 Lavender Brown is it\xe2\x80\xa6 because we don\'t get along at all," she explained."What bloody hell no," Ron scrunched his nose "No I\'m dating someone in Hufflepuff you might recognize her, her aunt works in the Ministry,""Language and oh thank Merlin," Hermione sighed in relief then got curious "Then who are you dating Ron?""Sorry and it\'s Susan Bones,""You mean Amelia Bones niece?""Yeah that\'s her,""Really?" Hermione gawked at this and felt so relieved "When did this happen?" she asked curiously got the best of her.Ron flushed at this "Well\xe2\x80\xa6 err\xe2\x80\xa6 after she lost her aunt Amelia I noticed how sad she was, so I got a bit worried and decided to cheer her up then we started to hang out a lot more that I started to really like her ya know," he explained.Hermione gave her \'awe\' face "That\'s\xe2\x80\xa6 actually really sweet Ron\xe2\x80\xa6 we\'re really growing up huh\xe2\x80\xa6 " she began to say causing Ron and Harry to chuckle by nodding in agreement "Well I\'m glad to hear that since\xe2\x80\xa6 Harry and I got some news,""What news?""Err\xe2\x80\xa6 well last August \xe2\x80\xa6 Harry and I eloped,"Ron blank stared at her "What\xe2\x80\xa6""Harry and I eloped so we\'re officially married,""YOU WHAT?! How come I wasn\'t invited,""Err\xe2\x80\xa6 it was \xe2\x80\xa6 a last minute kind of thing and besides we\'ve been together for nearly a year\xe2\x80\xa6 and I asked her to marry me\xe2\x80\xa6 are you angry?""Angry...I\'m-I\'m-" Ron began to say and took a deep breath tiredly "I\'m a bit hurt but, why wasn\'t I invited to the wedding,""With the death eaters after me I didn\'t want to risk it\xe2\x80\xa6 besides\xe2\x80\xa6 we had a reason to do that,""What do you mean?""Considering Voldemort-" Harry was cut off by Ron."Don\'t say his name,"Harry rolled his eyes at Ron "You know who coming after you and your family\xe2\x80\xa6 including Hermione\'s\xe2\x80\xa6 that\'s when Mia thought of a plan and send her family away from England and the war,""You send your family away Mione\xe2\x80\xa6""Yes\xe2\x80\xa6 it was a bit difficult but, my sister Ariel is with them in Australia while my big brother Jay with his wife who\'s 6 \xc2\xbd months pregnant when they were away expecting Quadruplets \'Quads\' are living in a small town.. In America,""A small town where?""I can\'t tell you\xe2\x80\xa6""Mia maybe you should tell him since he\'s our best friend,""Your right... fine but, this is between the three of us promise,""Promise,""My big brother Jay is in Forks, Washington\xe2\x80\xa6 our home town,""Home town?""Yes, I was born in America but, we moved back in England when I was about \xe2\x80\xa6 7 years old I think I was pretty young but, we would visit my uncle Charlie every summer it\'s a perfect getaway from the war since nothing happens over there,""Makes sense\xe2\x80\xa6 " Ron nodded at this about to speak up but, Hermione continued to talk."Oh and one more thing Ron,""Yeah\xe2\x80\xa6 what is it?""Before my family left \xe2\x80\xa6 I destroyed my family files, their locations everything so there\'s no way either of the death eaters or \xe2\x80\xa6 \'you-know-who\' will ever find them I made sure of it,""Good\xe2\x80\xa6 at least we know you\'re family is okay but, what about mine?""I\'m sure we\'ll figure something out and besides I always thought that you and Harry gotten together in our 4th year since you guys were always together and all,""That\'s because we were fighting that time remember between you two,""I apologized over that Mione,""I know you did but, don\'t assume that Harry and I got together than \xe2\x80\xa6 we didn\'t get together\xe2\x80\xa6 until \xe2\x80\xa6 maybe during 5th year\xe2\x80\xa6 at first we didn\'t know what our feelings were but, I suppose our connection has always been like that ya know,""Yeah I do know\xe2\x80\xa6 and I\'m really glad we can stay best friends over this but, if you guys get married again can I be the best man,""Of course Ron and we feel really bad that we couldn\'t bring you to our small wedding though,""I get it you guys can just make it up to me later,"[end of flashback] \xe2\x80\xa6It took a few weeks into 4 \xc2\xbd months before Harry and Hermione finally decided to announce that they\'re dating by telling the rest of the Weasley\'s, family and friends as for Ginny they were both wary hoping they wouldn\'t lose her friendship but, like her brother Ron she\'s happy for them as she stated she wanted to be the maid of honor and godmother if they ever have a child together causing Harry and Hermione to flush over the news but, they both decided to keep their elopement a secret as neither of them wanted to lose one another; during their 6th year in August 23, 2003 a small wedding the only ones who were there were Hermione\'s family, her parents Dan & Emma Granger, her older brother Jay, his wife Mal with their children quadruplets \'quads\' Logan Matthew Granger (OC), Zander Maxwell Neil Granger \'Zayne\' (OC), Charles William Jr Granger II \'CJ\' (OC) and Sophia Carson Rose Granger \'Sophy\' who were eight months old that time it wasn\'t a big affair but, it had to be done.The war was becoming dangerous so when Hermione told her parents about the war they agreed to be send away to Australia since that was the first place they thought of but, Ariel insisted that instead of going to Australia they go to Forks, Washington since nothing happens there; Jay, however being their eldest son agreed to that so that\'s what they did; Hermione\'s family made the move in the last minute to Forks, Washington instead of Australia so keep off the death eaters off track from coming after them through Hermione\'s connection with her husband Harry Potter as neither of them wanted them safe not wanting them to get killed from the death eaters especially when they all knew that Voldemort will send them after Hermione or Ron and their families to get to Harry by torturing them to death being Harry\'s best friends which neither of wanted that so that\'s what they did.The day Hermione\'s family was going away, Hermione made sure to save all her family files inside her flash drive werewolf pendant for safe keeping then destroyed everything to keep off the death eaters off track from tracking them down to get them killed. No one knew Harry and Hermione got married except within Hermione\'s family and Ron but, did promise to have another wedding for their close friends and family though maybe within a few years when things get back to normal but, when has it ever been?Jay and Mal with their children, Ariel would accompany with their parents Dan & Emma Granger to Forks, Washington to keep an eye out from the death eaters and keep them safe. It was the safest location for the Granger\'s at first Hermione was going to send them to Australia but, Jay pointed out it would\'ve been too obvious, so it had to be a small town where no one would expect thus Forks, Washington came into the conversation.Once the war was over, the light side won it took a long time for Harry Potter, Hermione Potter \'nee Granger and Ron Weasley to heal and get over the horrors that happened to them during the war especially for Hermione and what helped was going through therapy. Hermione however refused to take therapy sessions since it wasn\'t exactly pleasant to go through her memories without her permission even if it was for the greater good but, it was important to Harry as he asked Hermione\'s family\'s permission to marry Hermione the proper way for their incoming 4th year wedding anniversary while being together for six years by exchanging their vows as they hugged Harry a little tighter telling them that he\'s already married to their daughter Hermione as they both considers Harry as their son while protecting their little girl from the horrors during the war so they agreed for them to get married the way it should\'ve been except with their closest friends and family.That was when Harry started planned and decided to take his wife Hermione on a romantic picnic in their favorite spot with rose petals as a heart that spelled \'Will you marry me so we can have an actually wedding of your dreams with a honeymoon and gain a family with me,\' before he can go on one knee to show the ring but, Hermione had other plans already teared up happily however she jumped her husband by saying \'Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!\' causing the couple to tumble down the small hill with an \'oomph\' while everyone cheered happily for the couple.Another six months later they were announced as Harry and Hermione Potter again; this time this wedding was a private ceremony just their close friends and family nothing to flashy or anything but, it was a perfect wedding for the Potter\'s once again that Harry surprised his wife by going to Hawaii for their honeymoon for a whole month visiting Rebecca Finau \'Bex\' and her husband Solomon Finau a surfer she met in Forks who happened to be Hermione\'s childhood friend who\'s like a little sister to Hermione by showing them around in Hawaii who was one of the bridesmaids in the wedding.Their wedding however was in a private wedding\xe2\x80\x94no one knew the location except the ones who were invited through Hermione\'s port key of her creations that neither Harry or Hermione wanted the paparazzi to find out anything about them or how they gained children which was a big surprise; they ended up having five children\xe2\x80\x94quintuplets \'quints\' three boys and two girls\xe2\x80\x94James Sirius Potter \'Jamie\' II (OC), Seth Oliver Potter (OC), Liliana Luna Rosalie Potter \'Lily\' II (OC), Evelynn Sophia Carson Potter \'Evie\' (OC) and Harrison Jacob Daniel Potter \'Henry\' (OC) who are born in August 13, 2006 (time 12:00 a.m. five minutes apart from each other) much to Hermione\'s shocked that she fainted over the news but, eventually got used to it and the Potter family lived happily since then who kept their lives quite private away from the Wizarding World as they both refused to talk about the war or their families as they both agreed to protect their children away from the paparazzi\'s eyes especially Rita Skeeter who would do anything to twist any story about the \'Golden Trio\' but, would automatically refused to have an interview with her.However, it changed drastically three years ago, after winning the war you would think that Harry Potter, his wife Hermione Potter and Ron Weasley\'s lives would catch a break away from the paparazzi\'s eyes but, oh no being the heroes to defeat the \'dark wizard\' and win the war but, it didn\'t seem help much until the day they got killed\xe2\x80\x94after the 3rd anniversary of winning the war it didn\'t take long that everything changed drastically for Hermione to lose her husband Harry Potter, their best friend Ron Weasley, his wife Susan Weasley \'nee Bones in St. Mungo\'s being attacked by death eaters with everyone inside being killed left to right that it changed everything for Hermione being Head Healer in St. Mungo\'s along with Ginerva Finnegan, Luna Malfoy and Hannah Thomas along with the rest of their co-workers were attacked but, Hermione and Luna managed to survive with a few survivors while protecting the children although they didn\'t find out that they lost their best friend Ginny Finnegan and her family\xe2\x80\x94Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas decided to surprise their wives Ginny Finnegan for their 2nd year anniversary by taking her to Greece with their children and Dean Thomas and his wife Hannah to accompany them as a surprise but, neither of them survived much to the girls sadness along with the nurses, doctors and patients who also lost their lives that day.That same day Hermione learned that she lost her husband Harry Potter and Ron Weasley who were auror\'s in a mission-apparently they found out about the raid attacks from the death eaters attacking St. Mungo\'s who got killed leaving her as a single mother, a widow over their children James, Seth, Lily, Evie & Henry with Rose, Daisy, Amelia and Hugo Weasley who were babysit by Remus, Tonks and Andromeda at Number 12 Grimmauld Place\xe2\x80\x94Roselynn Taylor Weasley \'Rose\' (OC), Daisy Jasmine Weasley \'DJ\' (OC), Amelia Susan Weasley \'Nia\' (OC) and Hugo Joseph Weasley (OC) being the same age as her children James, Seth, Lily, Sophia and Henry since their birthday is August 14, 2006 12:00 a.m. 5-10 minutes apart from the quints birthday after attending to their parents testimony and wills at the bank\xe2\x80\x94it stated that Hermione Potter gained full custody over Ron & Susan\'s children if anything were to happen to them they were quite pacific that left her to faint that Charlie, George & Fred panicked catching their sister-in-law before she hit the ground.It took some time to wrap around her head but, she immediately adopted them into her family once it was official. Only a few survivors survived over the raid attacks thanks to the death eaters destroying the whole hospital in St. Mungo\'s & the Burrow. The ones who survived in the Weasley family was Charlie\'s Weasley \'Charlie\' (OC) George Weasley & Fred Weasley with their kids. It would\'ve took 2 \xc2\xbd years to build a brand-new hospital with extra security and very powerful words that were quite powerful under Hermione Potter\'s influence due to how she\'s always been good with charms and spells; the attacks were too fast that she didn\'t realize that same day that she learned what happened at the Burrow who were instantly killed by the fire thanks to another set of raid death eaters; Everyone in the Wizarding World who knew the Weasley family were good, amazing people known as \'blood-traitors\' for most purebloods families but, they were saddening to hear about their loss who were friends with them especially from the only ones who survived who three of Arthur & Molly\'s children with their families\xe2\x80\x94Charles Weasley \'Charlie\' being the single bachelor, George Weasley with his wife Aries Joelle Taylor Weasley \'nee Granger with their children Percival Lawrence Weasley \'Percy\' II (OC), Esmeralda Daisy Weasley \'Emery\' (OC), Arthur Corey Weasley II (OC) while Ariel being 7 \xc2\xbd months pregnant expecting triplets\xe2\x80\x94William Simon Weasley \'Bill\' (OC), Ronald Rupert Billius Weasley \'Ron or Ronny\' II (OC) and Ginevra Molly Weasley \'Gin or Ginny\' II (OC) being named after their siblings.It was going to be a surprise the family in the Weasley family brunch in Sunday before their family got killed then there\'s Fred Weasley with his two children who he saved from being attacked in St. Mungo\'s and immediately adopted them as his children\xe2\x80\x94Bartholomew Henry Weasley \'Barry\' (OC) & Anastasia Selena Rose Weasley \'Ana\' (OC) who are rather close with their families since then and rather fond of their godmother Hermione Potter who always give them presents through her travels.Arthur Weasley and his wife Molly with their children with their families\xe2\x80\x94William Arthur Weasley \'Bill\', his wife Fleur Weasley \'nee Delacour with their children Victoire who was only 3 years old who gained a little sister Dominique Weasley, Percy with his wife Audrey with their two daughters Molly and Lucille \'Lucy\' Weasley who were killed when Percy jumped to protect his family that instantly killed them all then there\'s their youngest and only daughter Ginny Weasley with her husband Seamus Finnigan with their children Corey Seamus Finnigan II \'Shay, Dean Thomas Finnagin II (OC), & Bonnie Jennifer Finnigan along with Dean Thomas and his wife Hannah Thomas \'nee Abbott who was expecting their first child that time who were instantly killed being attacked by death eaters that same day in the Burrow being burned alive inside their childhood home.It was then Hermione learned and felt angry who was in charge of both raid attacks by the death eaters\xe2\x80\x94main circle of death eaters of their Dark Lord Voldemort\xe2\x80\x94their master \xe2\x80\xa6 Dolohov, Greyback, Yaxley and worst of all Rodolphus Lestrange, husband of Bellatrix Lestrange with a few others unnamed who wanted full ultimate revenge against those who won the war who killed their master Lord Voldemort; if there was one thing that Hermione was good at it was charms and spells especially jinx spells that she made of her creations that were quite dangerous that instantly killed the death eaters to their deaths. It was then Hermione realize that she alone with no one to talk too and decided to move away from England and live in a small town called Forks, Washington in America to start fresh away from the memories of the horrors of the war and most of all the paparazzi following her every move, badgering her on how she felt about the raid death eaters attacks in St. Mungo\'s hospital, the Burrow and learning what happen to Fleur\'s family who were also killed in France much to their horror.Hermione was heartbroken when she heard about Gabriella and her parents were killed during a death eater raid in France by burying them in the same burial plot with the Weasley\'s, and her husband Harry to be buried together then put the strongest wards of protections spells with a password that only she would know. If anyone were to come through let\'s just say they\'ll be burned alive with no questions. It would seem that Hermione Potter can\'t seem to catch a break which is why she felt moving away to America in her home town would be a good start for herself and her family after losing her sister-in-law Mal Granger (OC), her sister Sophia Cartwright, along with her parents Dan & Emma Granger who got killed from a car crash before she lost her husband Harry Potter, their best friend Ron Weasley his wife Susan Weasley, along with Arthur and Molly Weasley (Mr. & Mrs. Weasley), Bill Weasley & his family, Percy & his family, Ginny & her family she needed to get away from the horrors from everything.Since St. Mungo\'s was still under construction at the time she had no choice but, work in the Ministry much to her annoyance and decided to be the Head Department of Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures with her partner Luna Malfoy who seemed to be helpful as her best friend and partner for the job but, thanks to Kingsley\'s connection she can work at home instead of the office because she didn\'t want to be away from the children not without the best protection spells and jinxes spells around the house; after what happen last time she wasn\'t going to take any more chances that\'s how she got herself some help from Remus and Tonks Lupin with their son Teddy Lupin who happens to be hers and Harry\'s godson who was only six years old when her husband Harry Potter got killed that left him quite devastated because he really close with his godfather very much along with his extended cousins in the Weasley family. Tonks being 6 \xc2\xbd months pregnant with Jacob James Lupin \'Jake or J.J.\' (OC), Lilliana Rose Lupin \'Lili\' (OC), Sirius Regulus Lupin \'Padfoot\' II (OC) and Andromeda Narcissa Jasmine Lupin \'Aubree\' II (OC)\xe2\x80\x94quadruplets two boys and two girls which was unexpected but, happy with the news that left Teddy happy as he couldn\'t wait to be a big brother to his fond siblings.Hermione didn\'t have no other friends besides Neville Longbottom, his husband Blaise Zabini with their children who are twins Leonardo Francis Longbottom-Zabini \'Leo\' (OC) and Alice Gemini Longbottom \'Ali\' (OC) who are 6 years old, they both decided to gain a surrogate mother, one of Hermione\'s childhood friends Hayley who\'s gaining triplets\xe2\x80\x94two boys and a girl much to their delight by naming them Vincent Angelo Longbottom-Zabini \'Vinny\' (OC), Alekander James Isaac Longbottom-Zabini \'Alek\' (OC) & Selena Anastasia Rose Longbottom-Zabini \'Lena or Selly\' (OC) then there\'s Draco Malfoy, Luna\'s husband with their children\xe2\x80\x94Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy their eldest who\'s going to be 6 years old in August like her children, then there\'s the twins Lorcan Harrison and Lysander Ronald Malfoy who are 4 years old while Luna being 7 \xc2\xbd months pregnant along with their daughter Pandora Selene Jaelynn Malfoy \'Penny\' (OC).However one of her friends who she made in her final year\xe2\x80\x94who were in Slytherin Theodore Nott and his wife Pansy Nott \'nee Parkinson with their children\xe2\x80\x94Olivia Cameron Nott \'Liv\' (OC), Maddison Dove Nott \'Maddie\' (OC) who is six years old then Veronica Camilla Nott \'Ronnie or Vee\' (OC) who\'s 3 years old, much to Pansy\'s surprised she\'s expecting another baby\xe2\x80\x94more like triplets who\'s currently 6 \xc2\xbd months expecting triplets all boys by naming them after their friends in Slytherin\xe2\x80\x94Gregory Tyler \'Greg or G.T.\', Vincent Blaise Nott \'Vin or Vinny\' and Marcus Tristen Nott \'Marc\' (OC) much to Theo\'s delight he\'s excited to teach his sons everything.Then there\'s Hermione\'s siblings\xe2\x80\x94Jayden Milo Cameron Granger \'Jay\' with his wife Maliyah Dove Cameron Granger \'nee Cartwright who gained eight children\xe2\x80\x94 quadruplets \'quads\' Logan Matthew Granger (OC), Zander Maxwell Neil Granger \'Zayne\' (OC), Charles William Jr Granger II \'CJ\' (OC) and Sophia Carson Rose Granger \'Sophy\' (OC) who are now 14 years old being in their 3rd year in Hogwarts their eldest children then Newton Corey Granger \'Newt\' (OC) & Nelson James Granger \'Nelly\' (OC) who\'s 12 years old who\'s in their 1rst year in Hogwarts then there\'s youngest daughters/nieces Arianna Lucille Cartwright-Granger \'Aria\' (OC) & Hannah Ashley Cartwright-Granger being 10 years old about to attend Hogwarts next year but, unfortunately when Aria and Hannah were born their mother Sophia died by giving birth to her daughters after losing a lot of blood it broke Mal\'s heart and immediately adopted the girls as their the mini version doppelg\xc3\xa4nger of their mother of Sophia and her twin sister Mal\xe2\x80\x94the only family that Mal had left was gone.It was hard at first but, now since the death eaters raid attack in St. Mungo\'s\xe2\x80\x94Jay lost the love of his life, his best friend Mal, the mother of eight children but, he has huge help from his best friend Charlie Weasley as their godfather to the kids besides Hermione, Harry, Ariel, George, Fred, Neville, Luna, while gained new friendships with Draco Malfoy, Blaise Zabini, Theodore Nott and his wife Pansy Parkinson with their children etc you can say they\'re very close to one another. Charlie Weasley and Fred Weasley are the only ones who are single well Fred used to be in a relationship with Katie Bell but, apparently, she cheated on him with Marcus Flint who happened to be in Slytherin and learned that they got killed in St. Mungo\'s as well\xe2\x80\x94it didn\'t end well at first that it took most of their friends to calm down Hermione when she learned what happen to hex the witch only to find out they instantly got killed a week later only she was a bit conflicted since the damage was done but, did attend their funerals however,Charlie Weasley been a huge help for Jay who helped him a lot over the years but, during that time they both realize they had feelings for each other but, never did anything yet due to not wanting to ruin their friendship because of it but, Jay\'s and Mal\'s older children\xe2\x80\x94the quadruplets Logan, Zander, CJ & Sophy being in their 3rd year in Hogwarts can literally tell that there\'s romance in the air between their dad Jay and their uncle/godfather Charlie Weasley.As for Charlie Weasley, being the single bachelor Hermione can tell that Charlie is sadden over his family losses besides Fred and George Weasley with their families\xe2\x80\x94it helped a lot that Jay and Charlie started hanging out again since Maliyah\'s death being killed from a raid of death eaters six years ago\xe2\x80\x94it was hard for Jay to open-up a little being a single father of eight children\xe2\x80\x94his eldest children Logan, Zander, CJ (Charles William Jr), and Sophy who are now 14 years old, then there\'s the twins Newt and Nelly who are both boys being 12 years old who started two years later in Hogwarts and the youngest Aria and Hannah will be joining within two years since they\'re 9 years old so he had a lot of help from his two sisters and their friends whenever they could; it also helped that the kids being best friends with one another who are the same age as Jay\'s and Mal\'s kids helped a lot too so it wasn\'t too bad.Sometimes Viktor (Hermione\'s ex-boyfriend) would come by to visit in England and happy that they\'re still friends after all it was a mutual break up between the former couple that Viktor is one of the godfathers to the quints since Viktor is good friends with Harry and Hermione when they were in school in their 4th year. Hermione also kept in contact with her teachers Professor McGonagall, Professor Sprouts, and Professor Flitwick but, it was difficult since Minerva became the headmistress of Hogwarts while the two professors are now retired so they\'re currently living in their hometown living a peaceful life with their families.Now that Hermione Potter was now a single widow with nine children while her brother Jay being a single widow of eight children being all grown up now she didn\'t know what else to do to help her older brother; at first Jay became quite depress that left her to call Charlie Weasley crying her eyes out worriedly sick to help her brother Jay that Charlie stopped what he was doing at work and immediately rushed over to Jay\'s side the minute he learned what happened to Maliyah \'Mal\'\xe2\x80\x94Jay\'s wife, the mother of their children. Charlie couldn\'t imagine how hard that was losing the love of his life and being best friends that he was he did what anyone could help heal over the death of his wife Maliyah \'Mal\' and when Charlie, Fred and George lost their family in the Burrow being killed by the fire; Jay did the same by helping him heal being each other\'s rocks you can say it brought them quite close to each other if either of them needed to cry and balance each other schedules to hang out by spending a lot of time together.In the beginning of the year Hermione told everyone that she was planning on moving away from England but, didn\'t say where until Jay and Ariel learned where it was\xe2\x80\x94it was in America in a small town called Forks, Washington where their uncle Charlie lives. It took some time but, Hermione got everything settled, found a house to live well a manor called the \'Black Pearl\' under the Black\'s properties apparently, it\'s in the reservation of La Push which is perfect, the properties, the money, the schools transfers for the school, school activities and get a steady job but, her uncle Charlie thought of everything for her to settle down in her hometown. The manor seemed it need to be fixed up and added a few arrangements to fix up the place before the rest of her family live with her first.As for Fred and George joke shop their business is doing quite well around the Wizarding World especially when they extended stores to other countries\xe2\x80\x94The first five shops are in Switzerland, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Japan and Ireland and Sydney, Australia after making some new friends over the years through Hermione\'s connections you can say it brought their joke shop huge business deals all over the country instead of just going through the store, they can order online through owl or computer muggle or wizard/witch style thanks to Hermione\'s advances of technology it made the business quite popular because of it. Their next location is in America but, they have no idea which city in America but, they\'ll figure it out with Hermione\'s, Ariel\'s and Jay\'s help. Their hoping to find a place in Seattle, Washington when they move to America with Hermione and their family.During their Saturday brunch between the Granger\'s\xe2\x80\x94Jay called them that they needed to talk like a family talk kind of thing and he seemed nervous although what he didn\'t realized was that his sisters Ariel and Hermione knew that their brother was bisexual without his knowledge\xe2\x80\x94which never bothered them over the years as they both wanted Jay to be happy so when she met Maliyah they instantly clicked and got along very well which was a good thing because Jay was very close with his family especially his sisters.The first four years, Jay lost his wife Mal who was diagnosed with cancer (leukemia) and died in her sleep peacefully it was hard at first but, he finally balanced his life and took a breather being the best dad he could be by raising his children the way he and his wife Mal would\'ve wanted them to be\xe2\x80\x94he told his sisters that it was time for him to move on, he will always love his wife Mal and he knew that she want him to be happy since Mal always knew about him being bisexual so it didn\'t bother her or anything that it took Hermione a few seconds to let it all in to figure out what he just said in a quick reply. Both his sisters Ariel and Hermione both hugged him telling him that neither of them had a problem with him being Bisexual, gay, or whatever he was if he\'s happy they\'ll both support him 100%, Jay felt relieved that he ended up ordering the biggest sundae to celebrate as they both rock being his awesome sisters causing them to laugh.Hermione shook her head from the memory as she was looking around the house one last time\xe2\x80\x94she stood in the middle of the living room where she and her family would have Sunday family tea it was their family time together at least as a child anyway before they went to do their own thing but, it was her favorite past time which is why she would keep the tradition with her children and hope they\'d do the same when they fall in love, get married and have a family of their own but, right now she\'s going to spend as much as time with her children as much as possible even if it\'s going to be her last week in England for a long while. However, for Hermione her childhood home in London, it wasn\'t far off away from where Harry used to live with his awful relatives as they could\'ve hung out in the summer but, apparently it didn\'t happen unless it was with Ron and his family at the Burrow.A distant memory of her husband Harry and her when they first started to confess their love for each other during Christmas came through her mind\xe2\x80\xa6. Hermione felt a pang in her heart as a few memories slipped through her mental shields.Hermione laid sprawled out across her bed, the only sound in the room being her soft snores and heavy breathing. Harry was up early for once as he snuck into her bedroom and carefully made his way on her bed."Morning sexy," Harry whispered huskily into her ear.Hermione unfortunately screamed as she shot up, eyes wide. Once she had calmed her heart down slightly she lightly whacked Harry on the arm who was now clutching his stomach while laughing."Harry. James. Potter you do not do that to me," Hermione smacked him on the arm causing Harry to look confuse not realizing it was Christmas "But, since you\'re here what are you doing up early\xe2\x80\x94" she then looked at their clock "At 5:30 in the morning Harry James Potter since I usually be the one that wakes you and Ron up," she playfully scolding him."Well, since we\'re not in the Burrow I figured I do something different for a change and\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s Christmas," Harry explained with a huge grin on his face. Hermione gasped stared at him for a few seconds before engulfing him into a hug."Oh my gosh Harry! Happy Christmas," Hermione squealed. They stayed there hugging for a bit longer but, then pulled away, Harry slightly blushing.Harry coughed "Happy Christmas Mione. So, I um\xe2\x80\xa6 I got you something Mione," he stated holding out a present nervously. Hermione giggled a bit and began opening it. Once she opened it, she gasps, eyes wide at the object in her hands. It was the newest edition of \'Hogwarts a History\' and before Harry can finish his sentence with "It\'s not much but\xe2\x80\x94oomph" as she had engulfed Harry into another huge hug that cause the two to tumble down with made another \'oomph\' once again."Oh, my gosh Harry are you alright?" Hermione asked worriedly looking down.Harry chuckled "Oh don\'t mind me Mione I\'ll be alright in fact you can lay on top of me all you want lovely" he says wiggling his eyebrows causing Hermione to blush."Prat," Hermione huffed playfully smacked him on the arm again holding her book closely while Harry chuckled as they both sat up sitting down on the bed getting comfortable "But, Harry how did you manage to get this? It\'s not meant to be out in a couple of months yet?"Harry gave a shrug "I have my ways," he replied with a smug smirk which left them to laugh."But, why Harry?" Hermione asked in a more serious tone. Harry was quiet for a bit, obviously having an argument with himself about telling her something important. After a minute or two he gave her an exasperated sigh and decided to just tell her."I Love You," Harry stated, staring at Hermione straight in the eyes. Hermione sat there for a minute letting it sink in and had a small smile appeared on her face. Harry took that as a sign that she was going to let him down "But, I know you\'re probably don\'t feel the same way and I don\'t want to ruin our friendship so I\xe2\x80\x94 "Harry was suddenly cut off when he felt Hermione\'s lips crashing down into his. It took a short moment for him to realize what was happening but, soon replied moving his lips with hers, pushing her against her headboard. After a while, the two-split up apart gasping for air."I love you too Harry," Hermione shyly replied, and Harry\'s face turned into a huge grin. He turned around and began to forage inside his backpack looking for something. After a minute, Harry turned back around a small box in his hands."I got you another present and I wasn\'t sure about giving it to you before now that I ended up with some help from both your siblings Jay and Ariel as I needed their opinion on it but, now I am more certain that you\'re going to love it now," Harry explained by giving it to her. She looked at him suspiciously but, also curious opening the small box.Her eyes widen to a size of saucers as she looked down inside the box.There laid a beautiful white gold, heart shaped locket. The size was big of a pendant that she saw in muggle London; not too big or small just the right size with different swirls, patterns and small stars on the side. When Hermione turned it over and a small lit her face as she read the word \'Always\' engraved on the back. She turned it back around and opened it to see multiply of pictures of her parents, grandparents, Ariel, Jay, with their husband/wife and kids, Sirius, Harry\'s parents Lily and James, Remus with Tonks and their godson Teddy, then there\'s the Weasley family with their families, then there\'s Harry and herself from the Yule ball together last year it\'s almost like an album but, inside the locket that she had tears in her eyes. Hermione can tell that there\'s an undetectable extension charm that can hold as many pictures inside which would explain the multiple of pictures inside her locket with the people she loves in her whole entire family.~*~End of Chapter One~*~What do you think of the first chapter so far\xe2\x80\xa6? Like it... love it? I know I made a few changes Hermione being a widow and a single mother of quintuplets \'quints\' James, Seth, Lily, Evie & Henry while being the adopted mother to Ron and Susan\'s children\xe2\x80\x94Rose, Daisy, Amelia and Hugo Weasley-Potter it\'s a lot to take in but, I didn\'t want her to be by herself despite how she\'s a mother of nine children. Charlie, Fred, George Weasley with his wife Ariel 7 1/2 months pregnant (Hermione\'s older sister/wife to George) with their children, Fred with his two children Barry and Anastasia, Charlie being the single bachelor/uncle then there\'s Jay (Hermione\'s older brother) who\'s also a widow of eight children.Remus, Tonks being 6 \xc2\xbd months pregnant with quadruplets \'quads\', their son Teddy, the grandmother Andromeda (Tonk\'s mother), Draco, his wife Luna being 7 \xc2\xbd months pregnant with their daughter and their children, Blaise, his husband Neville with their children, Theo & Pansy being 6 1/2 months with their children will be joining them along the ride. It\'s a lot of people isn\'t it but, not too much. I don\'t want to make it too obvious but, that\'s what I was going for because I don\'t want Hermione to distant herself from everyone especially in the Wizarding World but, she has her extended family and knowing they\'ll support her no matter what. Hope you guys enjoy the first chapter ^_^\nA/N: Thank you guys so much for the reviews, following and support. I was beyond in awe when I saw how many people loved this story. I\'m so, so, so, so, sorry for not responding you guys earlier I\'ve been busy nonstop with work and school balancing my schedule tends to get me busy, so I thought I write you guys before I continue the next chapter.Guest\xe2\x80\x9404/02/17: Thank you so much for loving my story!Kat\xe2\x80\x94 04/03/17: Thank you for the review! And I will be updating quite soon with new chapters coming your way.Guest\xe2\x80\x9404/14/17: Thank you so much for loving my story and I will be updating within this week.Bluestorm28\xe2\x80\x9404/15/17: Well, technically Harry isn\'t dead per say\xe2\x80\x94he just been in hiding making everyone thinking he\'s dead and I decided that Hermione will not only be with Harry but, with Seth and Jacob because I feel like that Jacob is better off without Bella and I don\'t really like Bella. Let\'s just say Hermione is going to be surprised to her husband alive when they re-meet again in Forks trust me she\'ll be up for a shock and going to learn about his creature inheritance. Being a mother of the quints and godmother to Ron and Susan\'s children is a lot to take in for Hermione but, don\'t worry it will come to light soon just be patient I hope that helps a lot.Guest #1\xe2\x80\x9404/15/17: Thanks so much! I will be update soon when I get a chance.Guest #2\xe2\x80\x9404/15/17: Awe thanks and don\'t worry I\'ma twist a few things between the chapters but, I have a few things planned up in each chapter and thank you so much!Guest #3\xe2\x80\x9404/215/17: Awe thanksSereniteRose: Thank you for the sinecure review and yes, I\'m thinking of the powers for Hermione\xe2\x80\x94controlling elements water, earth, fire and wind. Shy? Hmm I can\'t really see Hermione shy after all she just won the Second Wizarding War but, then again, I can picture her being the shy type towards others (sort of) as for her hobbies I was thinking that Hermione will be good prodigy in music, dancing Jazz, Ballet, Tap, Hip Pop, being a mother of nine children I can see her spending a lot of with her children dancing around having fun with them and being athletic yes! We\'re both thinking the same thing (lol) getting along with everyone. I was thinking she and Mike Newton would be childhood friends but, noticed how Mike changed over the years\xe2\x80\x94their friendship would be strained because of it so in a way Mike will be maturing a lot little by little in the chapters but, not much with Bella though since let\'s be honest here I don\'t like her for shit \xf0\x9f\x98\x90 Hermione will get along with the Cullens\xe2\x80\x94Jasper Hale, Rosalie Hale and Emmett Cullen mostly; Jasper because they both went through the war, for Rosalie on how they both got tortured and being raped as for Emmett because I felt that it would remind Hermione of a big teddy bear like her brother but, blood Charlie Weasley and Jay Granger\xe2\x80\x94they\'re both like big teddy bears so they\'ll get along quite well. As for Edward he\'s going to be very annoyed (lol) I pictured Edward trying to read Hermione\'s mind without her permission and let\'s just say he\'s up for a big surprise while for Alice I think Hermione will be keeping her distance due to how she\'s a physic which would make Alice quite sad because she wants to be Hermione\'s friend too but, at the same time it would amuse Hermione a bit!As for Harry coming back well technically he\'s not dead and I\'ll give you one clue let\'s just say Harry will come back from the dead and its part of his creature inheritance that\'s all I\'m going to say. I\'m adding the fact that Draco and the gang will be coming along to the trip but, not another week since they have a few things they needed to take care of first but, don\'t worry they\'ll be living in Forks, Washington and awe thanks. I made Hermione mother of Quintuplets \'Quints\' which is five children and the adopted mother to Ron and Susan\'s children\xe2\x80\x94Rose, DJ (Daisy Jasmine), Amelia Susan \'Mia or Lia\' and Hugo being the same age since their birthday is 2 days apart from each other so yes, it\'s nine children, her huge family to watch over. And thank you for loving my stories ha-ha! I\'ll be sure to not to disappoint you bud since Ron and his wife Susan got killed from the death eaters raid attack in St. Mungo\'s as they instantly got killed along with a few others.Guest\xe2\x80\x9404/16/17: Awe thanks I\'ll be sure not to disappoint you guys there will be more to come.lizziestrong\xe2\x80\x9404/16/17: Thanks for the review!And that\'s the end of the reviews! I\'ll be sure to update whenever I can. Now for the next Chapter 2.Chapter Two: Last Minute Plans\xe2\x80\xa6(a/n: Hi Everyone, sorry for pausing this part of the story but, I needed your suggestions of what I should make in this story mostly in the next chapters that I\'m continuing to write right now. I know the general direction of where I want to go with it out though\xe2\x80\xa6 also I was thinking of making Hermione being an *imprint* from one of the pack members (cough*Jacob Black & Seth Clearwater*cough) since there\'s not a lot of stories between Hermione with three guys?) which would make this story a bit twisted mixed with unknown tales on Hermione\'s past life. Hermione will be with Harry, Jacob and Seth only because I\'m curious on how well it would turn out to be honest)Here are some questions that I thought would get you guys going and if you want you can let me know your answers.1) So, who do you think should be dissed in this story? (honestly, I\'m thinking of Bella Swan mostly, with Jessica Stanley and Lauren never knew her last name\xe2\x80\x94only being jealous, I\'m pretty sure we all know that I don\'t like Isabella (Bella) since they don\'t get along very well but, Jessica will apologize while Lauren will be moving away.2) What are some traits/habits you think that Hermione should pick up (for example: I\'m going to make her athletic now through American sports (Soccer, tennis, volleyball, basketball, running tracks to keep her fit and strong) and she\'ll have 2 elder siblings Jayden and Ariel (Yes, she\'ll have two siblings)?3) What do you think Hermione\'s personality should be like?4) Do you think she\'d make any friends/enemies at her school? If so, who?5) What do you think of her relationships with the Cullens would be like? Should she be close to them and if so who?6) What do you think of her relationship with Sam and the pack? (I already thought of Sam, Leah, Jake and Seth being her childhood friends along with Mike Newton which Hermione calls him Mikko as a nickname) as they kept in touch over the years until things get dangerous in Hogwarts thus the letters stopped after the end of her 4th year\xe2\x80\xa6 in Hogwarts. So, they haven\'t talked in a long time until they\'re-met again in Harry and Hermione\'s wedding but, they\'ll be reconnecting once she arrived in Forks? But, if you have any suggestions on who she should be close to please don\'t hesitate to let me know.7) What should her relationship with Charlie and Bella be like (I thought about making Bella and Hermione hate each other, Jay and Ariel don\'t get along with Bella as they\'re quite protective with their little sister Hermione thus their relationship became strained so the hate/like relationship between the cousins and Charlie would be close to his nephew and nieces because of it their his family members left in his side of the family besides their parents that know that Jay, Ariel and Hermione have magic being wizard and witches and will be protective with his only family left\xe2\x80\x94also Charlie Swan will be adopting children\xe2\x80\x94quints\xe2\x80\x94three boys and two girls? What names should I name for the quints? Should they be muggle non-magical or magical? Or mixed both? Let me know?8) What should Hermione\'s relationship be like with the people in the wizarding world? (the only one who survived Fred, George and Charlie Weasley, Remus and Tonks Lupin with their son Teddy Lupin, Andromeda Tonks, Draco Malfoy with his wife Luna Malfoy \'nee Lovegood, Neville Longbottom with his husband Blaise Zabini then there\'s Theodore Nott with his wife Pansy Nott \'nee Parkinson with their children)Here\'s the children of everyone\'s\xe2\x80\x94Harry and Hermione family of children (James Sirius \'Jamie\' (OC), Seth Oliver Cameron (OC), Liliana Luna Rosalie \'Lily\' (OC), Evelynn Sophia Carson \'Evie\' & Harrison Daniel Jacob Potter \'Henry\' (OC) who are born in August 13, 2006 and will be turning 6 years old, since this story will take between Twilight: New Moon & Eclipse and after Harry Potter: Deathly Hallows Part 2 six years after the war;

(Hermione will be attending in Forks High so Sam and the pack transferred to Forks High due to their old high school LaPush is under construction so it\'s going to take a whole year to finish everything extending a few classrooms, adding a few more buildings, extending the Drama Arts department, including the Sports department etc so they had to stay at least a year in Forks High before they head back to their old high school at least for Paul, Quil, Embry, Jake, Seth, Brady and Collin anyway; Sam, Jared and Leah will be teacher\'s aide/security guards around the school since Forks High also extended their school into a big campus as well with a lot of students the head principal decided to extend the school into a bigger campus that would hold at least 5,000 students total. So, which classes do you think Hermione should elect in and what would she be good at?10) What should Hermione\'s talent be? (for example: Hermione loves to sing, dance, play piano, guitar, or maybe painting, drawing, maybe write stories of her adventures with her two best friends Harry and Ron, where she and Harry love story began\xe2\x80\xa6got married, with their children, photography to take pictures)I also added Hermione will be a widow mother, of 9 children quintuplets; she and Harry got married secretly in a small wedding with their friends and family before everything went into chaos in their lives. So, she\'ll be a mother of quadruplets: James Sirius Potter II (Jamie) (OC), Seth Oliver (OC), Harrison Daniel Jacob Potter II \'Henry\' (OC), Lillian Rose Taylor Potter \'Lily\' (OC), and Evelynn Sophia Carson Potter \'Evie\' (OC) then there\'s Teddy Lupin, Hermione and Harry are both his godparents; Hermione immediately gained custody over Ron and Susan\'s children Roselynn Taylor Weasley \'Rose\' (OC), Daisy Jasmine Weasley \'DJ\' (OC), Amelia Susan Weasley \'Nia\' (OC) & Hugo Joseph Weasley (OC) after losing their parents when they were attacked in St. Mungo\'s three years ago.Also, if there\'s anything you want to put into this story, doesn\'t matter how random it was let me know and I\'ll put them into the story. Just put it in the reviews you can just PM me so that way no one can steal or hear your ideas and thus it would be a surprise to him or her when I write it or when it happens! I enjoy writing stories mainly fanfictions where I put in the ideas or things the readers want to happen. So that way, when the scene comes they can be like "OH! Hey that was my idea. How cool is that huh? Lol? I tend to like the stories more where something wants to happen I want to happen will happen. sometimes I tend to find some ideas from other fanfictions stories but, nothing fits on what I wanted well some were but, I don\'t want to steal their ideas or be offended by that \xe2\x80\xa6 so hopefully you guys will show some ideas and suggestions on what should happen in the story.Soooooooooooooooo\xe2\x80\xa6 sorry again for the interruption but, the rest of the chapter will be starting shortly and hopefully you guys will enjoy the rest of the chapter when I know what to write and all that. Now, here\'s the rest of the story. Thanks guys! I hope to hear from you soon! Ciao for now dolls!Chapter Three: Number 12 Grimmauld PlaceChapter Four: Ariel\'s Distress News!"True\xe2\x80\xa6" Tonks murmured looking around at Number 12 Grimmauld Place that used to be one of the Headquarters for the Order "How much more did you need to pack Mia?" she explained."I already got the children stuff all packed along with their parents Ron and Susan it\'s a good thing I took a lot of pictures of us as kids so I can tell the children all about them if they asked, along with mine and \xe2\x80\xa6 Harry\'s\xe2\x80\xa6along with Ron\'s, Susan\'s and the rest of the Weasley\'s all in my bag" Hermione began to say causing Remus and Tonks quiet knowing how sensitive the subject was for her "I just need to pack the bottom floor and I should be done by tomorrow at most before we leave early in Friday," she explained.Remus nodded at this "Perfect, what time is our flight, and did you tell your sister and brother about the arrangements yet because I know how worried you are when we heard what happened to Mal I can\'t even imagine how Jay\'s feeling\xe2\x80\xa6 after what happen to Mal and Sophy," he explained."I told them that we\'re going to leave this week in Friday 3:30 in the morning I figured it\'s the best way to start leaving quite early without the press trailing or finding out about us leaving the country," Hermione paused for a moment leaning against her seat "Speaking of quadruplets did you guys managed what names you\'re going to name them since they\'re both boys and girls from the doctors," she explained.Remus and Tonks smiled at each other "Sounds like a plan and we have\xe2\x80\xa6 and we decided to wait until the quadruplets are born which shouldn\'t be long, so you have to wait just like the rest of everyone at the baby shower," Tonks explained.Hermione pouted "Not one little hint Tonks?" she asked."Not even one luv you should be patient until the quadruplets be born," Tonks smirked "Trust me Remus and I are very pacific on what names we\'re going to name and I\'m pretty sure if Sirius was here he would\'ve been really honored including Harry, his parents and everyone else too," she explained."Damn," Hermione pouted causing Remus and Tonks to laugh "Well it\'s a good thing I already got your present with the quadruplets then, so you must wait till the baby shower," she smirked "I can\'t believe you\'re carrying four children in there\xe2\x80\xa6 it must horrid not moving much huh?" sh explained."Oh, you have no idea how did you manage to carry quints when you were pregnant with them Mia?" Tonks pouted at this "I don\'t know how you do it,""It wasn\'t easy that\'s for sure knowing Harry and Ron being protected with me along with Twix\xe2\x80\xa6 since she was pregnant around the same time I was except carrying quadruplets like you are considering we had a double wedding that day with all four of us together" Hermione laughed at this "I\'m sure the girls and I will help as much as we can along with papa Remus," she explained."Touch\xc3\xa9," Remus chuckled "I have no doubt that you\'re going to love the names Hermione I bet everyone would love to help and can come up with names so it would be official" he paused for a moment looking at his wife Tonks who nodded at this "And speaking of our flight schedule sounds brilliant so what time should we wake up?" he explained."We\'re going to have to leave quite early around maybe around 12:00 in the morning in the latest since our flight is in 3:30 in the morning so it\'s the best way to start since it\'s less crowded that way and it\'s perfect for us to leave the country without anyone detected us," Hermione explained."Sounds good and don\'t you worry about the packing I\'ll finish up here while you talk to Ariel and Jay to let them know getting everything ready," Remus assured her."Are you sure\xe2\x80\xa6" Hermione weakly says."Yes, I\'m positive. So which rooms needs to pack and it won\'t be long till we get out of here without anyone finding out especially the paparazzi Mia," Remus explained.Hermione looked around scanning the places that need to be packed which wasn\'t a lot "It\'s the Black Library, the children play room which I emptied the library before I left this morning and then there\'s both bedrooms upstairs and downstairs I figured you should pack Sirius old room and his brother Regulus since that needs to be emptied I haven\'t\xe2\x80\xa6 stepped in since \xe2\x80\xa6 Harry\xe2\x80\xa6" she murmured.Remus nodded at this "Don\'t worry I\'ll take care of it Mia anything else that needs to be packed?" he asked."Umm well Harry told me that most of Regulus things are with Kreacher since he\'s quite close with himsince he was born so I don\'t think you need to pack much in his room; I mostly packed his parent\'s things inside one of the Black\'s vaults so it\'s inside for safekeeping and I managed to find portraits of Harry\'s parents James and Lily along with Sirius and Regulus there so we can talk to them," Hermione explained."Really," Remus seemed surprised by this "I didn\'t know they made portraits," he murmured."I didn\'t either and I don\'t think Harry knew about it\xe2\x80\xa6 I even looked at the Potter vaults and found Harry\'s parents old trunks when they were in Hogwarts \xe2\x80\xa6 I\'ll look through it later since it\'s inside my bag for safe keeping and I was hoping to make a scrapbook out of it with all your old pictures together so that way you\'ll have some memories with your friends too, "Hermione paused for a moment "I bet if Harry knew about it he would\'ve be able to talk to them like he wanted, wouldn\'t he?" she explained."Even Regulus I thought he died\xe2\x80\xa6" Remus asked."He did but, apparently he left some memories it could be in his bedroom so you should check so it won\'t be in the wrong hands and I\'ll be sure to put it in the top of my list the minute we arrive to Forks so that way Kreacher can talk to him whenever he wants. I\'m sure he would love that," Hermione explained.Remus gave Hermione a comfort hug "Yeah I think Harry and Kreacher would\'ve loved that very much and I\'ll help you with the scrapbook I don\'t have a lot of pictures but, if I know Lily she must\'ve printed the pictures in her muggle camera back then so I\'m pretty sure it\'s a lot of pictures both muggle and magic cameras," he assured his adopted daughter "And I would love to talk to them when we set their pictures frame up. It would be nice to talk to them again," he explained."Yes, I think they would\'ve all love that papa Remus," Hermione murmured."Oh yes it would be nice to talk to Lily again along with James and Sirius they always been my favorite people to talk too growing up," Tonks began to say as she put her hand on her stomach fondly "I don\'t remember much of Regulus but, from what mum told me she was very fond of him as a child but, then grew up \xe2\x80\xa6 it was heartbreaking for mum when she heard what happened to him," she whispered."I hope so," Hermione murmured looking at her children "Are you sure you guys don\'t mind that Ariel and Jay are coming with their families with us to America?""We don\'t mind at all darling," Tonks smiled fondly at this "The more the merrier besides from what Ariel told me she said you guys used to do all sorts of mischief things with your friends back home?" she explained.Hermione giggled "Oh yes, it was rather fun actually we used to drive uncle Charlie mad including my parents back in the day but, it was good intentions though," she explained."I\'m sure it was your uncle Charlie, and your godparents showed us some pictures when you were children you were just a cute little thing I can see where the quints got their mischief from it wasn\'t just from Harry," Tonks chuckled causing Hermione to flush while Remus chuckled helping his wife up "I\'ll go start packing and Remus can watch the children," she announced."Oh no you don\'t you\'re going to watch the children in the playroom you\'re not allowed to walk that much since the quadruplets due date isn\'t for another 3 \xc2\xbd months and two weeks so I\'ll be the one to pack while you sit there and rest," Remus argued while Tonks pouted "You heard what the doctor said Dora you\'re in bed rest since we don\'t want anything to happen to the quadruplets luv now scoot and lay in bed we\'ll take care of the packing" he explained as he kissed her forehead heading upstairs to pack."You got to love that man," Tonks winked at Hermione after she gave a love sigh pouring herself a cup of tea "And I supposed he\'s right\xe2\x80\xa6I can\'t just stay in bed I\'ll be driving myself crazy which is why I decided I\'m going to play with Teddy and the children" she explained."I know but, he means well since you do need to stay in bed since the doctor said you\'re not supposed to move much\xe2\x80\xa6" Hermione sighed "But, I don\'t blame you though I was in the same way when I was carrying the quints it was a huge hassle for me since I wasn\'t used to it but, Harry and Ron were both so protective with me and Susan as neither of them wanted anything to happen to us along with the children. It\'s one of the reasons what I love about Harry and I\'m sure Susan felt the same way with Ron I just hope the children would know that Harry loves them very much as much as I do with them," she explained."Mia that boy loves you to death," Tonks chuckled "You should\'ve seen him when he was so excited to hear that you were coming to visit him and Sirius\xe2\x80\x94" she gave a small smile "It was like seeing James light up whenever he sees Lily. I remember them quite well they were very much in love even though it took Lily a long time to see pass the whole bully phase of his but, I had a feeling she loved him for a long time she just didn\'t explore those feelings until they reached in their 6th years in Hogwarts," this is when Tonks held Hermione into a hug "So I have no doubt Harry will always love you if you were to fall in love again\xe2\x80\xa6 and it just sucks he can\'t be here with us...along with the rest of our friends and family while everyone is packing and leaving England for good to start fresh," she explained pouting at this.Hermione sighed "I know he does and I always love him till death till us part it\'s just\xe2\x80\xa6 he died first \xe2\x80\xa6 before we can grow old together\xe2\x80\xa6" she held her tears but, had to wipe them quickly as she held her locket "I miss Harry so much\xe2\x80\xa6 the quints look so much like him\xe2\x80\xa6 especially the boys\xe2\x80\xa6while the girls look like me except the difference is that they have the same hair and eyes through Harry but, has my curls. I\'m just glad I didn\'t lose you guys either after what happen three years ago from the war," she explained."Me too if anything were to happen to us\xe2\x80\xa6 or my mum you and Harry would\'ve gained full custody over Teddy being his godparents," Tonks murmured.Hermione nodded at this knowing the situation "Well it\'s a good thing I saved you both from Dolohov and Bellatrix isn\'t it," she gave a wink causing Tonks to laugh as she and Remus owe Hermione their lives from nearly getting killed during the war when they were battling in Hogwarts then Hermione turned to her children "Teddy bear, Jamie Jam, Sethyboo, Henry, Lily, Evie, Rosie, Daisy, Amelia and Hugo I want you darlings to stay with your nana Tonks and your cousin Teddy while I pack the rest of our things before we move away from England to our new home in America alright darlings," she whispered."Okay momma, okay aunt Minnie," Teddy, Jamie, Seth, Henry and Lily, Evie, Rose, Daisy, Amelia and Hugo murmured nodding at this as they started to play with their toys. Hermione kissed her babies on the forehead as she headed upstairs to pack.Hermione started the first two floors and packed everything not wanting to leave everything behind\xe2\x80\xa6 she grabbed the letters between Harry and herself when they became friends, to best friends to where they started dating to where they got married filled with pictures, letters, poems, both muggle and wizarding style since there\'s a lot of pictures that she had to buy the whole isle of scrapbooks with supplies inside the shopping cart, a few glue guns filled with packs of glue, color paper, stickers, glitter, crayons, markers, color pencils, journals, she even got a printer to print the pictures without going to the store, the only thing she\'ll need was buying a lot of ink for the printer; it had everything they did back in Hogwarts with her friends \'The Golden Trio\' was what they were called in Hogwarts much to their displeasure but, they ignored it though, she even saved the letters from her friends from over the years when she first started in Hogwarts.The letters from Ginny, Ron, Percy, Bill, Fleur, Gabriella and their parents Mr. and Mrs. Decalour in France, Mr. and Mrs. Weasley sometimes, Charlie, Fred and George, then her siblings Jayden and Ariel then her childhood friends from La Push\xe2\x80\x94Sam Uley, Jacob Black, Leah Clearwater, Rebecca and Rachel Black, Seth Clearwater then there\'s Mike Newton but, calls him \'Mikko\' as a nickname until they lost in touch once she reached her 4th year with the war being dangerous not wanting to reveal their location from the death eaters and destroyed her families and friends location before the war started before she went away on a secret mission with Harry and Ron by winning the war\xe2\x80\x94afterwards she kept in touch with her uncle Charlie and invited him to the wedding this was before she learned about her estranged cousin Isabella (Bella) living with her uncle Charlie at the age of 16 in Forks.Hermione invited her godparents, Billy Black, Harry & Sue Clearwater with their children who were invited to come along; Sam Uley who was starting in high school, Leah Clearwater, Rachel and Rebecca Black were heading to school then Jacob Black with Seth Clearwater were beginning to head to middle school took tons of pictures knowing it would be a long while till they see each other again after catching up that weekend; Isabella Swan (Bella) or her estranged aunt was not invited in her wedding due to how Renee broke her uncle Charlie\'s heart and wasn\'t planning on doing so in the nearest future which was the feeling was mutual at least with Isabella anyway; her relationship with her aunt Renee was\xe2\x80\xa6 strained but, she was always polite with her ex-aunt despite everything, she also grabbed the rest of her letters from her friends from over the years before they got killed: The Weasley family, Dean Thomas, Seamus Finnigan, Susan Bones, Amelia Bones, Hannah Abbott, Luna Lovegood, Draco Malfoy, Blaise Zabini, Neville Longbottom, Pansy Parkinson, Theodore Nott, Remus Lupin, Nymphadora Tonks, Sirius Black this was before Sirius got killed she even saved the letters from Harry\'s parents when they were students in Hogwarts when they were in hiding before they got murdered by Voldemort in Halloween night and saved it inside her scrapbook.So many of her friends who she considers as family are dead from the raid of death eaters, some were from secret auror missions while others were killed during the second Wizarding War that was destroyed by children who weren\'t adults and didn\'t deserve to fight in this war but, it was necessary. The Weasley clan\xe2\x80\x94Arthur, Molly, Bill, his wife Fleur, Percy, his wife Audrey, Ron, his wife Susan, Ginny and her husband Seamus Finnigan with their children, along with Dean and his family who instantly got killed from the death eaters that cause a fire at the Burrow while at the same time the other half of the death eaters attacked in St. Mungo\'s where Neville\'s parents who were victims under Bellatrix Lestrange torture were instantly killed much to his sadness, his grandmother Augusta Longbottom given her old age she was also killed but, Neville and his husband Blaise believed to name their next child after Neville\'s grandmother which he knew that she\'ll be very honored and grateful for it. Ron and Susan\'s children managed to survive since they were watched with Tonks and her children at the time, so it made her in ease a bit.The only ones who survived was Draco Malfoy, his wife Luna Malfoy \'nee Lovegood, Blaise Zabini, his husband Neville Longbottom-Zabini, Theodore Nott, his wife Pansy Nott \'nee Parkinson who have children of their own, Charlie, Fred and George Weasley along with the teacher\'s staff Minerva McGonagall, Professor Flitwick, Professor Sprouts, Hagrid and his half-brother Grawp along with her siblings Jay and Ariel who gained a family over the years.One of the dangerous missions was her husband Harry being the Head Auror of the department\xe2\x80\x94classified missions that he can\'t talk about but, it got two of her best friends Harry Potter her husband, the love of her life and Ron Weasley with his wife Susan Weasley \'nee Bones killed during the death eaters raid attack at St. Mungo\'s by killing everyone in sight no one survived except the ones who fought back against the death eaters leaving Hermione being the widow mother of nine children because of it.Hermione was going through a very rough time losing the love of her life Harry Potter, their best friend Ron and his wife leaving their children orphans\xe2\x80\x94it made Hermione emotionless and pale that looked like she hasn\'t eaten or slept for weeks; it worry her sister Ariel and brother Jay whenever they have their lunch break the more they would spend the day together they would have worry looks thus made a decision to make their little sister their main priority by taking care of her whenever it would seem fit. The quints\xe2\x80\x94James Sirius \'Jamie,\' (OC), Seth Oliver (OC), Lillian Rosalie \'Lily\' (OC), Evelynn Sophia Carson \'Evie\' and Harrison Daniel Jacob \'Henry\' Potter (OC) were only three years old about to turn four years old that time that changed their whole lives for the Potter\'s family where they gained new family members that year; Ron and Susan Weasley \'nee Bones children Rosalynn Taylor \'Rose or Rosie\' (OC), Daisy Jasmine \'DJ\' (OC), Amelia Susan \'Nia\' (OC), and Hugo Junior Weasley (OC) being their adopted mother for gaining custody over the children.However, Hermione couldn\'t seem to catch a break because not long after she learned that one of her best friends Susan Weasley \'nee Bones was three months pregnant with their fifth child when she was killed that it broke her heart when she bumped into one of her childhood friends from her neighborhood Stella Rose Hart, who grieved over their friends who\'s also a muggleborn witch who attended a school in America before they lost in touch but, did learned about everyone\'s death in England so she send her sympathy over their lost.Hermione being the last to survive of the \'Golden Trio\' she buried everyone in the same burial grounds making sure to put powerful hexes, barriers and it had a password to get inside\xe2\x80\x94the ones who instantly lost their lives at the Burrow thanks to the explosion fire; Arthur, Molly, Bill, his wife Fleur with their daughters Victoire and Dominique while expecting a boy who was still early but, Fleur was going to tell Hermione who they named their son, Percy and his wife Audrey with their daughters Molly and Lucy, then Ginny with her husband Seamus Finnigan with their children, Dean with his family were all killed during the fire inside the Burrow, neither Hermione, Harry and Ron knew they were hosting a surprise party anniversary of the war for winning the war. It was their way for appreciating them that was until Hermione learned that her family and friends were killed during the fire, no bodies so she collected inside a jar cremated during that week neither of the Aurors can figure it out as they didn\'t recognize the death eaters signaturesFred, George and Charlie Weasley were away at work at the time when they learned the truth about their family which devastated them and broke their hearts as they got into depression so Hermione being the mama bear took them with her so they can live together which seemed to help a bit so they been living with Hermione, Tonks, Remus and their son Teddy in Number 12 Grimmauld Place since they\'re grieving in their own way while worrying everyone it\'s part of her nature really as she always scold the boys when they were students in Hogwarts since their first day.Hermione wiped the sweat off her forehead as the whole manor of Number 12 Grimmauld Place is now empty the only rooms that they\'re using is the living room and the kitchen as Luna wanted to have a farewell party for Hermione since she and her family are leaving this Friday with her family who are coming along with her to fix up the manor the \'Black Pearl\' in this small reservation in La Push\xe2\x80\x94it was almost Harry\'s birthday that Hermione felt a pain tug in her heart as it would be the third anniversary that she lost her husband Harry as they usually have a celebration in his birthday together but, this time\xe2\x80\xa6Hermione and the children wouldn\'t be living in England anymore but, her home town in Forks, Washington.It would be a first since it wouldn\'t be the same since he\'s buried in the Potter\'s plot burial with his parents James and Lily Potter but, moved them to the private burial where she buried everyone as she called a few friends to help move everyone\'s burial to Forks, Washington so they can be together again. However, for her sister Ariel and her husband George with their children, Remus, Tonks, with Teddy and Andromeda, then Charlie Weasley, Fred Weasley, Jay with his children, Luna and her husband Draco Malfoy with their children then Neville and his husband Blaise with their children will be accompany Hermione and her children to Forks, Washington and yes she realized it\'s a huge group but, wouldn\'t have it any other way but, what Hermione didn\'t know was that their estranged cousin Isabella was now living with their uncle Charlie but, Ariel and Jay knew about it but, kept their information to themselves until they figure out how to tell her before their arrival to Forks so it won\'t be awkward or cause more tension between the family.Once Hermione took a shower and change to her pajamas since she emptied most of the manor of Grimmauld Place she called Ariel from her two-sided mirror that she received from Sirius Black as a birthday present before he got killed from Bellatrix Lestrange at the Ministry in their 5th year in Hogwarts and realized it was still Sunday so she had four days left before she leaves in Friday.Hermione\'s older sister Ariel Weasley, sitting in her office shuffling some papers when she heard the two-sided mirror ringing when she answered"Hello?""Hey Ariel it\'s me!""Hey bumblebee," Ariel smiled greeting her little sister as she was shuffling some papers inside her office being the Head Healer in St. Mungo\'s "How are you? I feel like we haven\'t talked in forever what\'s up?""I\'m fine," Hermione replied clearly showing a fake smile which wasn\'t unnoticed from Ariel."Cookie\xe2\x80\xa6" Ariel started to say but, was cut off by her sister Hermione.Hermione sighed "Same as usual but, I\'m hanging in there\xe2\x80\xa6 I\'m getting better little by little\xe2\x80\xa6 I\'m just taking one day at a time and we just saw each other last Friday over our girls day remember," causing Ariel to giggle knowing that\'s true "And not much \xe2\x80\xa6 I just had a long today and sold the house of mum and dad\'s\xe2\x80\xa6 you know the one that we grew up in muggle England so it\'s ready to sell as we speak," she explained.Ariel soften her eyes "I know you don\'t want to talk about it but, it\'s okay to miss him he\'s your husband\xe2\x80\xa6and I know we have I was just trying to make you smile which worked sort of" she whispered.Hermione felt herself teared up giving a small smile "I know\xe2\x80\xa6and I appreciate that big sister \xe2\x80\xa6 I just don\'t want to talk about it\xe2\x80\xa6 if that\'s alright with you\xe2\x80\xa6" she whispered."Understandable I would\'ve felt the same way if I lost Georgie," Ariel soften her eyes at this and took a deep sigh "So you mentioned that you sold the house from who?" she explained."From mum and dad the one that we grew up in," Hermione pointed out."Our childhood home in muggle, London you mean?" Ariel asked frowning at this."Yes, that\'s the one since mum and dad \xe2\x80\xa6 are\xe2\x80\xa6 gone\xe2\x80\xa6 I figured it was time for us to sell the place\xe2\x80\xa6" Hermione murmured.Ariel grew quiet "Oh\xe2\x80\xa6 I wasn\'t aware you were going to do that today I could\'ve went with you on my lunch break," she explained."I know but, I don\'t mind at all since I know how busy you were being one of the Head Healers in St. Mungo\'s" Hermione waved it off "I needed\xe2\x80\xa6to take care of some business anyway \xe2\x80\xa6 which is one of the reasons why I called\xe2\x80\xa6 you remember when we planned on moving to America to live near uncle Charlie?" she explained."Of course, what about it?" Ariel began to say with a raise eyebrow "Don\'t tell me you change your mind cookie since everything is all packed and everything?" she explained.Hermione sighed "No, no of course not the plan to move to America is still in motion it\'s just-" she began to say as she put a silent charm around the office "Well I decided to switch our flights for this Friday instead of next week in Wednesday?" she explained.Ariel blinked her eyes owlish dumbly "Hold on backup you switch our flights," she began to say causing Hermione to nod at this "Not that I don\'t mind the switch but, why would you do that cookie I thought we were next week in Wednesday?" she explained.Hermione leaned back on her chair tiredly "I know it\'s last minute but, it\'s because of the paparazzi,"Ariel\'s eyes harden being the overprotective older sister "What did they do now?" she growled.Hermione sighed "Easy tiger same as usual, they\'ve been hounding me ever since we lost Harry, Ron, Susan and the rest of the Weasley\'s wanting to have an interview that it\'s been horrid being followed everywhere it\'s very tiring for me to \xe2\x80\xa6 live in peace with the children without being hounded by them and honestly I can\'t take it anymore so I just\xe2\x80\xa6called Lena my travel agent if there was any way to switch our flights which thankfully she found a couple of seats left in first class and I can\'t stay here another minute.. \xe2\x80\xa6 that\'s why I switched it this coming Friday instead of next week in Wednesday,"Ariel frowned being the concerned sister "Sweet Merlin\xe2\x80\xa6" she sighed running her hand through her hair stressfully "I can\'t even imagine how horrible and annoying that is as they couldn\'t stop following you around but, I didn\'t realize it was that bad and-hold on this Friday\xe2\x80\x94" she looked at the calendar "That\'s in four days," she cried out."I know\xe2\x80\xa6 but, it\'s \xe2\x80\xa6 I\'m just so tired\xe2\x80\xa6 of the paparazzi following my every move\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s sucking the energy out of me\xe2\x80\xa6I\'m sorry\xe2\x80\xa6" Hermione murmured.Ariel soften her eyes "Sweetie there\'s no need to apologize with the paparazzi following you guys I wouldn\'t blame you if you wanted to switch our flights which is why I packed early Fred and George just need to pack the last of their supplies at the store along with Jay and the kids with Charlie it\'s taken care of so don\'t even worry about it," she explained."Really?" Hermione eyes light up a little "You mean your not mad?" she asked."Mad of course not it\'s totally understandable I know it\'s last minute but, I\'ll get over it besides... Luna was the one that told me that you wanted to leave early that\'s why I packed early than necessary I even told Fred, George, Charlie & Jay to pack as well so we\'re all good babes,""You talked to Luna when?""Just a few minutes ago she had a doctor\'s appointment with our goddaughter Pandora \'Penny\' and had a vision\xe2\x80\xa6 she saw how you called your travel agent Lena was it\xe2\x80\xa6 wanting to switch the days for us to leave to Forks in Friday instead of next week in Wednesday that\'s when she saw me and told me to pack everything that we all need and tell Fred, George and Charlie along with Jay of course,""She did are you sure it\'s okay for you guys because I have last minute things I have to do before we leave since Remus and the house elves are taking care of the other stuff downstairs and the only things that we\'re going to use is the living room and the kitchen along with the playroom before we leave tin Friday,""That\'s completely fine since Fred, George and Charlie need to pack the rest of the supplies for the store anyway but, other than that we packed everything Mia and got that taken care of along with the kids things I mean I would\'ve felt the same way if I were in your shoes nugget if those crazy nutters was following my ever move too to get away from everything in the Wizarding World like you said the paparazzi became quite restless that it sucked up the energy out of you including that scoundrel woman Rita Skeeter of course," Ariel scowled as she hates Rita Skeeter to the death as she won\'t stop until she gets a juicy story only the problem was about Hermione and the Golden Trio since she\'s the only one left who survived from the raid attack thanks to the death eaters that cost so many lives including her husband Harry, their best friend Ronald Weasley, his wife Susan and a few others who lost their lives that day "Considering she wants all the juicy details on how Harry, Ron and the rest of the Weasley\'s family death\'s\xe2\x80\x94how can I could forget. I had to kick her out as she just came to ask for my one-to-one interview with the woman at work she was very demanding about the details that it nearly made me want to squish the little bug," she huffed at this "And she tried to get an interview from Jay as well somehow she found out that we\'re related to each other I don\'t know how but, she knows that we\'re family Mya," she explained."I\'m glad to hear that big sister since I just want to get this over it and I suppose it\'s a good thing that Luna had a vision and saw you during the hospital during her doctor\'s appointment isn\'t it, " Hermione smiled knowing her best friend "And I\'m glad that you guys packed everything so it will go as planned we\'re leaving in Friday and\xe2\x80\x94" she stopped to realize what her sister Ariel just said and scowled grumbling under her breath "She did what how the bloody hell did she\xe2\x80\x94I knew I should\'ve swash that little bug when I had a chance in 4th year," she sighed pinching her nose in annoyance and scowled "I\'m so sorry they bothered you Ariel\xe2\x80\xa6 I\'m just glad I called Lena to switch our flight dates instead of next week in Wednesday\xe2\x80\xa6 we\'ll be leaving this Friday-4 days from now since it\'s all set and I already talked to Kingsley today about the whole thing since he\'s going to set us the port keys and emergencies ones just in case when we head to the airport so it won\'t be much of a hassle for us since it\'s a huge group and all," she explained."Brilliant I\'ll let Jay, George and Fred know the plan is still in motion,""Good, so you talked to Luna and told them to pack ahead of schedule right,""I did knowing Luna she must\'ve got a vision because she called me right before I was going to call her and waiting for my signal for us to leave and told Draco, Blaise and Neville and the rest of the lot who\'s coming along\xe2\x80\x94and after I sold the house of mum and dad\'s\xe2\x80\xa6 that\'s when I went to talk to Kingsley to set us our port keys and after we talked. Speaking of Charlie, I should tell him about the plan since he\'s probably at work and helping out Fred and George or with Jay I\'m not exactly sure why but, I have a feeling that Jay and Charlie are secretly dating?""Dating what makes you think that?""I have a hutch you know I\'m never wrong about these things,""True\xe2\x80\xa6so I noticed that \xe2\x80\xa6 Harry\'s birthday is this Wednesday\xe2\x80\xa6are you going to visit him at the Potter\'s plot burial in Godric\'s Hallow are you and the children going to visit him in his birthday luv?"Hermione held her breath "Actually\xe2\x80\xa6now that I\'m talking to you\xe2\x80\xa6 I\'ve been thinking... of relocating Harry, Ron, Susan and everyone else to another private burial near our new place along with mum and daddy being buried in Forks it\'s extra protected with powerful wards thanks to me since I\'m the only one who knows the password\xe2\x80\xa6 I called Ruby and Yukiya to set things up for me\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s going to take under a month to set everything up but, it\'s not a problem for them to do it\xe2\x80\xa6 I figured it would be better if they were all together," she murmured while Ariel looked surprised but, nodded at this "And yes, I\'m thinking of bringing the children to visit their father Harry including Rose, Daisy, Amelia and Hugo to visit their parents Ron and Susan Weasley at the Weasley\'s family plot cemetery as they should be. It\'s going to be weird not visiting them every day now that we\'re moving to America and all," she explained."I had a feeling you would since mum and dad are buried in Forks since we set the funeral down there with uncle Charlie being the only family line in our family," Ariel sighed at this "And I don\'t mind you relocating everyone since Fred, George, and Charlie agreed to it since I\'ll let Aqua and Ruby know about the location and everything so I\'m pretty sure Harry and the others will understand why since they would\'ve felt the same way if things were reverse\xe2\x80\xa6 and I also think Jay\'s doing the same thing with Mal and Sophy\xe2\x80\xa6 since there\'s no room in England to bury out so I think relocating them would be good for all of us \xe2\x80\xa6 since none of us are going to be living here in England anymore\xe2\x80\xa6 along with the kids\xe2\x80\xa6 since they\'re already students they\'re getting so big especially the quadruplets Logan, Zander, CJ & Sophy\xe2\x80\xa6 they\'re going to be turn 14 years old very soon," she explained."Good\xe2\x80\xa6 I\'m glad everything\'s working out \xe2\x80\xa6 since it\'s their families after all.. and yes, Logan and the kids are getting older but, it\'s going to be different since they won\'t be attending Hogwarts anymore instead they\'ll be attending a muggle school, so they\'d be with their cousins and be close by in Forks as we planned,""Nugget we\'re all family here never forget no matter what you think so I\'m pretty sure it\'s fine and they do Logan and the kids can go to the Salem Academy of Magic like Jay and I did before we transferred schools to Hogwarts to be near you, mum and daddy back in the day so they wouldn\'t have to give up magic and everything,""I know it\'s just a lot to take in that\'s all and neither Logan or the kids don\'t have to give up magic I just want them to have a normal life but, let\'s be honest none of the kids will have a normal life since we\'re all wizards and witches but, I also don\'t want them to be kids where no one will know that their mum is famous in the Wizarding World because of the war. It\'s going to make the other kids to treat our kids differently because of it and I don\'t want that since it\'s the last thing I ever needed to deal with especially now,"Ariel grew quiet "I supposed you have a point... maybe we can talk to the kids and see what they say since it\'s their decision either or not they want to go to a different magic school or attend a muggle school like us," she pointed out.Hermione sighed "I had a feeling you\'d say that which is why I\'m thinking of telling my kids this when they\'re a bit older but, for now since they\'re still young they have plenty of time either or not they want to attend to another magic school in Washington\xe2\x80\x94Salem Academy of Magic or to a muggle school. I just don\'t want anyone to know who they are being that their parents are quite famous during the war in the Wizarding World they would\'ve take advantage of the children and I don\'t want that.""I agree on that nugget I\'m sure on whatever they decide we\'ll support them," Ariel offered causing Hermione to nod at this "So, we\'re really leaving in Friday huh?" she paused for a moment and scowled knowing the press "Because of the press following us our every move or in your case yours that must\'ve been annoying," she explained.Hermione grew quiet and gave a tired sigh "You have no idea and yes I\'m tired of being followed by the paparazzi who are being quite restless, following my every move, demanding an interview which we both know I\'ll refused to give another interview only to find out that they\'ll twist my words on what I really said that it\'s sucking out the energy out of me making me look quite pale and tired a lot," she began to say which Ariel frowned at this as she did notice the face expression from her little sister and worried about her a lot "And mostly I just miss uncle Charlie a lot including our childhood friends. It\'s been so long since I saw uncle Charlie or our friends\xe2\x80\xa6not since my wedding and I just want to get away from this place\xe2\x80\xa6 from the bad memories\xe2\x80\xa6 of the war\xe2\x80\xa6 but, not all of it were bad\xe2\x80\xa6 since Harry and I fell in love along the way which I will cherish forever but, it\'s too much for me\xe2\x80\xa6 I need to think about the children \xe2\x80\xa6and for myself so I figured we can leave early than planned," she explained.Ariel soften her eyes at her sister "I can understand that you want to start fresh cookie I get it more than you know since it\'s the same in my position too," she sighed at this "What time are we leaving again?""Our flight is in 3:30 in the morning so we should be getting ready by 12:00 in the morning the early we leave the faster we can get out of here,""That\'s so early though?""I know but, with the press following my every move especially Rita Skeeter I don\'t want to take any chances especially since neither of them knows about the quints since Harry and I eloped in our 6th year and eventually got a nice wedding in our 4th year wedding anniversary it\'s a good thing I took pictures of us together," Hermione smiled at the memory remembering that day on how surprised she was "Neither of the reporters knew that Harry and I got married twice or have kids, along with Ron and Susan got married with children with everyone else who has families of their own\xe2\x80\x94we were very pacific and discreet with the details about our family since no one knows about it except our family and friends who we trust," she pointed out."I remember from the past two weddings the first one you and Harry didn\'t bother to have a honeymoon due to the war and the 2nd time was for your 4th year wedding anniversary which was perfect\xe2\x80\xa6" Ariel pondered for a moment "I remember every details since I was the one that help Harry planned the whole thing \xe2\x80\xa6 we made sure to keep the wedding was in low profile away from England in one of those private islands that the Potter\'s owned it was very beautiful I\'m so glad we managed to get uncle Charlie to come along with uncle Billy, uncle Harry, auntie Sue with our friends back home to catch up with everything. It was nice to see everyone again," she murmured."Exactly so what do you think? Are you still willing to come with me despite the plans date changed in the last minute?" Hermione explained.Ariel chuckled "Obviously we\'re just leaving a week early than planned which is not a big deal for us considering uncle Charlie is expecting everyone nugget including the kids he\'s excited I can\'t wait to see him again," she sighed at this as she waved her wand sending a patronus to her husband George telling him the plan changed instead of leaving next week in Wednesday they\'ll be leaving this coming Friday so it\'s still in motion\xe2\x80\x94George and Ariel packed everything at their home including the joke shop which will be in charge with Lee Jordan and his wife Sesilya Jordan \'nee Woods with their children who are excited to live near the joke shop in Diagon Alley "Like I told you I already packed everything I just send word to Fred, George, Jay and Charlie since they\'re at the joke shop as we speak and told them the plan about us leaving in Friday within 4 days instead of next week in Wednesday speaking of our lovely uncle\xe2\x80\xa6 does uncle Charlie know that we\'re leaving this coming Friday and not next week in Wednesday?" she explained."Brilliant I\'m glad to hear that and I\'m sure Charlie would be coming back today to check in with the manor since he\'s going to help with the wards when we head over to the reservation in La Push since that\'s where the \'Black Pearl\' manor is\xe2\x80\xa6 apparently it\'s in La Push and don\'t worry about uncle Charlie not knowing that we\'re coming to live in Forks he already knows since I told him ahead of time," Hermione announced."He does," Ariel gawked at her sister "How?""I told him maybe around April and called him two nights ago asking him if he got everything prepared and he said that the house is ready for us,""Are you serious but, there\'s no room for all of us to fit in there,""The one that mum and dad house that they bought yes I suppose it\'s true since it\'s only what\xe2\x80\x94a seven-bedroom house with four bathrooms, a living room, dining room, a family room with an office and library, swimming pool, tennis court, and basketball court to play sports. It seems like a perfect place for a family but, we\'re not staying there Ariel. You and George with the kids are going to live there""What me and George with the kids? Why not you guys?""Because I have a huge family of children Ariel besides I figured it would be a good home for you guys since you can use the extra rooms when you extend your family since it\'s not far where the manor is that I\'m going to be staying?""Manor what manor?""The manor under the \'Black\'s\' properties that Sirius left me,""You mean there\'s a manor in Forks and we didn\'t even know about it,""Well actually it\'s in La Push\xe2\x80\xa6""Hold on backup there\'s a manor at the small reservation that\'s near uncle Billy, uncle Harry and auntie Sue is with our friends there,""Yes, that\'s the one,""What\'s the manor called again?""The Black Pearl apparently it was the hide out that Sirius would stay in when he was on the run a few years ago before we helped him get a fair trial that left him to be free and be the guardian of Harry thanks to us remember?""Oh yeah I remember you telling me that a few years ago when we were in Hogwarts and\xe2\x80\x94wait a minute isn\'t that a movie from the Pirates of the Caribbean?""Yes, apparently the Black family go way back to the 1920\'s when it first started with the pirates and all that,""Really?" Ariel looked skeptically "And yet they called the manor \'The Black Pearl\' for it\'s perks?" she explained."I guess so I\'m just glad it\'s in the reservation and not in Forks the last thing we need is anyone finding out about us living there besides uncle Charlie, uncle Billy, uncle Harry and auntie Sue,""True\xe2\x80\xa6 The Black Pearl huh it\'s a nice name\xe2\x80\xa6 so where do you want to meet? The airport or at Grimmauld Place,""Yes, I figured as much as it fits with the manor really and we\'ll meet at the airport\xe2\x80\x94Remus, Tonks with Teddy, Andromeda, then myself with my children will be one group then there\'s you, George with your kids, Fred, Charlie, Jay with his kids, Luna, Draco with their children, Blaise and his husband Neville with their children," Hermione began to say pausing for a moment "Well I was thinking of building a few properties around the land a private one\xe2\x80\xa6 and maybe a Quidditch field for the kids to play,""Are you serious that\'s going to be a lot of people to live in Mia?""Well we are a big family Ariel but, since Blaise and Draco will be in a business trip they\'ll be joining us in two weeks while Luna and Neville with the children be joining us"Ariel sighed "True, true what about Theo and Pansy with the kids?""I\'m not sure but, if they want to come along they would have to wait maybe a month or two before the houses are built to settle down for everything with Draco and the others help of course\xe2\x80\x94" Hermione paused for a moment "I actually thought we can build a few houses around the manor because the acres around the property are about 550,000 five hundred and fifty thousand acres wide and long it\'s near the first beach up the mountains cliffs" she explained."Really that\'s a huge property around La Push and I\'m pretty sure Draco along with the guys would love to help build that Quidditch field where the kids can play too,""I know not all of the reservation land but, the backyard is the mountain cliffs from all the way in the middle of the town line we can make a mini mall around the property, Fred and George can even extend their store if they wanted too,"Ariel gave a \'hum\' approval with a smile "Well I\'m not going to lie it\'s a big property and sounds brilliant I\'ll give the idea to Fred and George see what they think and get back to you tonight,""Sounds good I should let Jay know then,""There\'s no need for that,""Why not?"~*~End of Chapter Four~*~Whooo I\'m done with Ch. 4 and I\'m on a roll today since I haven\'t once stopped yet since it\'s still early for me to head to bed\xe2\x80\x94it\'s now 7:13 pm in the evening still have a long way to go who knows maybe I\'ll stop in Ch. 10 X\xe2\x80\x94cross your fingers and let me know what you think of the now rewritten chapters and added new chapters I also decided to mix it up a bit between the chapters. Ciao for now dolls ^_^\nChapter Five: Sisterly Heart to Heart Talk"Because I\'m going to meet him in my lunch hour in about 10 minutes that\'s why,""Oh that\'s even more brilliant I just wanted to be sure that\'s all,""Cookie what\'s this about?... are you sure you want to live in Forks?""Yes, I do,""Are you sure like absolutely sure,""Yes I need this fresh start Ariel... not only for the kids but, for myself... I need to move on with my life...but, are you sure you guys want to go with me? You guys have your own life to deal with,"Ariel soften her eyes over her little sister "Sweetie I can\'t imagine losing the love of your life, your best friends and the Weasley\'s being our second family losing their lives like that.. but, deep down I think they all want us to move on with our lives and when you thought about moving away to America in our home town in Forks no less\xe2\x80\xa6 I thought it was the best plan you ever thought about since this happen to all of us\xe2\x80\xa6 we all need to move on and I\'m pretty sure that Harry...Ron\xe2\x80\xa6.Susan.. Ginny\xe2\x80\xa6 Seamus...Dean\xe2\x80\xa6 Hannah\xe2\x80\xa6 Percy..Audrey\xe2\x80\xa6 Bill.. Fleur\xe2\x80\xa6 the kids\xe2\x80\xa6 Mr. and Mrs. Weasley would want all of us to move on our lives and want you to be happy especially Harry \xe2\x80\xa6 and maybe fall in love again\xe2\x80\xa6 he does want you to be happy\xe2\x80\xa6" she began to say causing Hermione to close her eyes sadly feeling the pain in her heart "I know losing Harry\xe2\x80\xa6 Ron\xe2\x80\xa6 Ginny\xe2\x80\xa6 Seamus, Dean, Susan, Hannah and the rest of the Weasley\'s was hard losing them\xe2\x80\xa6 thanks to those\xe2\x80\xa6 death eaters\xe2\x80\xa6 but, I\'m pretty sure if they were in my position .. they would\'ve said the same thing\xe2\x80\xa6 they would\'ve want you to move on Mia\xe2\x80\xa6 and as for Jay and me\xe2\x80\xa6 we talked about a million of times\xe2\x80\xa6 we both agreed to accompany you not because it\'s our home town but, we both miss uncle Charlie as much as you do\xe2\x80\xa6 and taking this big step to start fresh is what we both want \xe2\x80\xa6 not only for us but, for the children\xe2\x80\xa6 that\'s never going to change no matter so we\'re going okay," she explained."Okay and your right \xe2\x80\xa6 I do need to move on but, it\'s so hard\xe2\x80\xa6 " Hermione whimpered."I know babez\xe2\x80\xa6 but, Harry would want you to move on \xe2\x80\xa6 " Ariel whispered."I know\xe2\x80\xa6 " Hermione began to say holding her breath "I\'m so glad you guys are going with me,""We wouldn\'t have it any other way babez and speaking of the children they\'re best friends, cousins no less how can we even separate them\xe2\x80\xa6 they\'ll be very upset and who are we to separate their lovely best friends bond hmm?" Ariel began to say with a tiredly sigh causing Hermione to nod knowing she\'s right "Speaking of plans I\'ll be sure to give Fred and George\'s the heads up about the new property since it\'s pretty huge so I have no doubt they\'ll love the idea, including building new houses, stores, maybe a private park for the kids within our property and we can also build a villa with all sorts of stores. And speaking of ideas I been wanting to ask since I never got a chance but, are you thinking of enrolling into school down in America Mia?" she explained.Hermione sighed leaning against her chair tiredly "At first I didn\'t want too since I already graduated from Hogwarts after the war ended," she drifted off which Ariel nodded at this knowing this "It seems rubbish to be honest with you," she explained."How come? You love going to school Mia?""Well yes, of course I do \xe2\x80\xa6" Hermione murmured "But, considering I\'m over 18 it would be a bit weird going to high school when I\'m 25 years old,""You\'re hardly look 25 years old Mia if it wasn\'t for the time-turner in your 3rd year we would\'ve been in the same age as Sammy being 23 years old but, getting married young tends to do that cookie bear,"Hermione flushed at this "It\'s not like I haven\'t thought about it since I have the quints and the kids\xe2\x80\x94James, Seth, Lily, Evie and Henry then there\'s Rose, Daisy, Amelia and Hugo to think about I can\'t just leave them at the house\xe2\x80\xa6 I mean I\'m supposed to look well as a high school student but, considering I already graduated with honors in Hogwarts I didn\'t think I needed to go back to a muggle high school since I aged quite quickly than I thought\xe2\x80\xa6 I always feel so tired lately and it\'s \xe2\x80\xa6.not making me happy more like depress most of the time," she began to say which Ariel noticed at this and couldn\'t help but, frown; she just hopes when they get back home it would make her sister Hermione and brother Jay feel a lot better since they always been happy in Forks as children "But, I suppose I could... go back to school, a muggle high school no less\xe2\x80\xa6 uncle Charlie insisted though so he helped me enroll into Forks High since I\'m not exactly familiar with the school system in America," she explained."First of all you been through a lot so I think it\'s completely understandable that you feel so tired lately but, considering we\'re moving I think it would good for all of us especially with you since you need a break from everything and this is your chance to relax be a teenager for once but, then again we\'re not exactly teenagers anymore since we have children of our own" Ariel steadied her breath leaning against her chair staring at her pictures of her family "As for Charlie and the rest of the lot they\'ll be staying at the house watching the children while you, Luna, Draco, Neville, Blaise, Theo and Pansy enroll as high school students while I\'m pregnant with the girls-Luna, Pansy and Tonks. Obviously it\'s going to cause a huge scandal but, we don\'t need that so they\'ll be attending the muggle school with you; if anything I bet we can use a camouflage spell to hide how far along we are in school," she explained"I know we could considering I know the spell in the back of my head since I did the spell when I was pregnant with the Quints whenever I have a doctor\'s appointments and everything," Hermione pointed out."Exactly besides Remus and Tonks will probably work with uncle Charlie in the police force since they need extra help, Fred, George will be busy finding a place to extend their joke shop in Washington which I will be helping them while looking for a job at the hospital while the rest of our children will be either attending the magic school Salem Academy of Magic or muggle school it\'s really up to them really\xe2\x80\x94which I have a feeling you\'d enroll the kids to a school anyway, so you got that taken care off," Ariel began to say raising her eyebrow knowing her little sister likes to be prepared with that kind of stuff "Second of all your right American schools are quite different from England Mia but, if moving away from England to start fresh \xe2\x80\xa6 without the press finding us \xe2\x80\xa6 will make you heal slowly \xe2\x80\xa6 if that\'s what you really want to do \xe2\x80\xa6 then Jay and I will always support you \xe2\x80\xa6 we\'ll even find ourselves some jobs so no one will get suspicious. Are you sure you don\'t want to enroll into La Push High instead?" Ariel explained.Hermione pondered what her older sister Ariel answer "Okay you got a point there but, it\'s a lot harder than I thought\xe2\x80\xa6 losing everyone \xe2\x80\xa6 my late husband Harry\xe2\x80\xa6 Ron\xe2\x80\xa6 Susan\xe2\x80\xa6 Seamus\xe2\x80\xa6 Ginny\xe2\x80\xa6 Dean\xe2\x80\xa6 and the rest of the Weasley\'s with their children \xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s a lot to take in \xe2\x80\xa6 but, I need this \xe2\x80\xa6 I need to heal in my own pace so I can move on with my life and if moving to Forks will do that than yes I\'m willing to try if you guys are which is one of the reasons why I\'m moving\xe2\x80\xa6far away from this place\xe2\x80\xa6and it\'s a good thing that I already enrolled the kids to a school for magical and non-magical kids that\'s across from Forks High so it\'s taken care off," she sighed sipping her tea despite how she looked really tired from packing everything "And for your other question that was my first choice but, after talking to uncle Charlie last night he told me that La Push High is under construction so the school won\'t open within a year so most of the students who attended there all transferred into Forks High Ariel so instead of 300 students; they now hold 4,000 thousand students all together at the school now because Sammy and his co-workers adding new buildings in Forks High during the year and now it\'s holding that much students in their school," she explained."I\'m always am nugget and oh really..." Ariel drifted off biting her lip nervously at this with a worry look which thankfully Hermione didn\'t noticed at least not yet "I didn\'t even know that or heard about the news since I stayed in touch with Bex, Rae and Leah from the reservation\xe2\x80\xa6they never mentioned that the school was under construction they probably didn\'t know about it... I assumed\xe2\x80\xa6" she sighed stretching her neck a bit "Well if that\'s the only school that would accept new students then like I said Jay and I will always support you cookie but, there\'s something that\xe2\x80\xa6 I have to tell you\xe2\x80\xa6" she explained."I think for Leah and Rae they must\'ve been in college not realizing the changes around town so I hardly doubt they would know about it and I really appreciate the support Ariel, you and Jay really are the best big sister and brother a sister can ever ask for," Hermione nodded at this noticing Ariel\'s tone of voice by tilting her head curiously "Oh really? What is it? Is uncle Charlie alright?""Anything for you doll and uncle Charlie\'s fine\xe2\x80\xa6 but, it\'s not about uncle Charlie\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s about his daughter from his 2nd marriage when he married that muggle Renee I never liked her which is why I don\'t call her auntie after when I learned what she did but, that\'s besides the point of this conversation but, do you remember Isabella our \xe2\x80\xa6 estrange cousin don\'t you\xe2\x80\xa6""Barely \xe2\x80\xa6yes\xe2\x80\xa6what about her?""Apparently she\'s now living with uncle Charlie\xe2\x80\xa6"Hermione eyes turned hard at this with fire on her eyes (a/n: one of her powers is dragon fire, water, earth and wind) "What?" she hissed at this that her eyes glowed with fire (meaning she\'s angry and pissed) part of St. Mungo\'s and Number 12 Grimmauld Place starting shaking causing everyone to panic kind of "Since when?""For a...while\xe2\x80\xa6""How long is awhile Ariel\xe2\x80\xa6"Ariel winced at her harsh tone noticing the building shaking "Cookie you need to calm down,"[no answer] \xe2\x80\xa6"Hermione Anastasia Sophia Carson Jean Potter?! You need to calm down before you cause everyone to panic since you\'re practically shaking the entire city," Ariel pointed out "Please\xe2\x80\xa6 I know your angry and you have every right to be \xe2\x80\xa6 but, you need to calm down before you scare the kids and that\'s the last thing we need right now," she cried out.Hermione took a deep breath as her eyes glowed back to normal to calm herself down not wanting to scare the children "Right\xe2\x80\xa6sorry when exactly did Isabella came to Forks last time I heard she didn\'t want anything to do with Forks that broke uncle Charlie\'s heart or do you not remember how heartbroken uncle Charlie was," she hissed at this "Why wasn\'t I informed about this before," she cried out in anger."Of course, I remember how uncle Charlie was upset you weren\'t the only person who loves and care about uncle Charlie cookie\xe2\x80\xa6" Ariel steadied her breath "And \xe2\x80\xa6she started to arrive there around when she was 15\xe2\x80\xa6 I think that was almost three years ago\xe2\x80\x94apparently she\'s graduating high school within this year\xe2\x80\xa6" she explained.Hermione grew quiet and silent which isn\'t a good thing."Mia\xe2\x80\xa6"[no answer] \xe2\x80\xa6"Mia\xe2\x80\xa6"[no answer] \xe2\x80\xa6"Hermione Anastasia Sophia Carson Jean Potter?! Please talk to me!" Ariel cried out in panic causing Hermione swore under her breath and poke her tongue against her left cheek very annoyed that her hair started glowing red and gold pacing back and forth in her office\xe2\x80\x94bringing her inner dragon within herself and only a few people can calm down the Gryffindor Princess and this is one of those days."Are you telling me that Isabella Marie Swan is going to be attending that same school as me," Hermione harshly hissed at her sister; as you can tell her magic has grown over the years."Yes\xe2\x80\xa6"Hermione took a deep breath to calm herself down as she can feel her magic playing with the dragon fire between her fingers in a very calm way which is never a good thing when it comes with her emotions "Of all the schools in the world it had to be the one in Forks\xe2\x80\xa6. how long" she stiffly replied.Ariel bitten her bottom lip nervously "Cookie\xe2\x80\xa6" but, she was cut off by Hermione."Aries Joelle Taylor Weasley?! How long have you known" Hermione growled as her eyes glowed "Ariel\xe2\x80\xa6"Ariel gulped nervously "I knew\xe2\x80\xa6 for \xe2\x80\xa6 umm\xe2\x80\xa6 nearly \xe2\x80\xa6 six years\xe2\x80\xa6"At first it was quiet\xe2\x80\xa6 as you can hear Teddy, James, Seth, Lily, Evie, Henry, Rose, Daisy, Amelia and Hugo playing in their playroom until-"SIX YEARS?!" Hermione exclaimed causing the house to shake causing Teddy to widen his eyes in horror that Remus and Tonks raced over to the children close "YOU KNEW FOR SIX YEARS!? HOW THE BLOODY HELL DID I NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS AND BEING THE LAST PERSON TO FIND OUT?!"Remus winced at this mumbling under his breath "I have a feeling\xe2\x80\xa6 that\'s Mia\xe2\x80\xa6."Tonks snorted "Ya think\xe2\x80\xa6come on darlings let\'s uh\xe2\x80\xa6 play that dragon game huh?""Mama\xe2\x80\xa6 who\'s yelling?""That\'s just your godmother Hermione she\'s a bit angry at your other godmother Ariel,"Teddy being the curious one "For what\xe2\x80\xa6 what did auntie Ariel do?""Nothing for you to worry about darling you know sisters," Tonks weakly says "Hopefully the little ones won\'t be like that huh,""Oh Merlin I hope not," Remus grumbled causing Tonks to squat him on the shoulder "I\'m kidding shhh I can hear them from the other side of the room,""Shhh don\'t eavesdrop it\'s rude darling,""Sorry...it\'s not like I can help it\xe2\x80\xa6 do you not want me to tell you what they\'re talking about,"Tonks looked around causing Teddy and the kids to play in their bedrooms upstairs as Kreacher and the house elves were watching over them while they sneaked a bit to the library "Well what are you waiting for what are they saying?""Hold on let me just-ah ha there you go\xe2\x80\xa6 if we\'re really quiet we can actually listen\xe2\x80\xa6" Remus murmured as they got the extended ears against the door where they heard parts of the conversation-back in the Black Library."Are you calm now?""No I am not calm why didn\'t you just tell me this before,""We had other important things to worry about then Isabella,"Remus and Tonks looked confuse \'Isabella?\' as they both thought who is she?"What does that have to do with this conversation Ariel,""Not until you calm down\xe2\x80\xa6.you\'re a bit strong then you realize when it comes with your magic nugget\xe2\x80\xa6 please\xe2\x80\xa6 think of the kids\xe2\x80\xa6"Hermione sighed at this "Fine\xe2\x80\xa6 fine\xe2\x80\xa6" as her magic is now cool off "Now will you explain please,""Well\xe2\x80\xa6 y-y-y-tend to overreact a bit,""Overreact when have I ever overreact Ariel?""I could think of a few things but, honestly I didn\'t find out until Jay told me and I was going to tell you honestly I was we both were but-but-but, you were a bit occupied with the war cookie,""The war? You mean to tell me that she was living with uncle Charlie when we were in the middle of the bloody war,""Well\xe2\x80\xa6 no\xe2\x80\xa6 she was still living with her mother by then but, I\'m talking about the past three years \xe2\x80\xa6 when we lost everyone\xe2\x80\xa6 and ummm\xe2\x80\xa6 Jay knows more than I do\xe2\x80\xa6 and I know you\'re angry but, Jay and I knew how you feel about her since we never got along with as kids\xe2\x80\xa6 are you angry\xe2\x80\xa6?""Are you telling me \xe2\x80\xa6 that our stupid dimwitted cousin \xe2\x80\xa6 been stirring trouble while the rest of us \xe2\x80\xa6 were. .. dealing with death eaters\xe2\x80\xa6 being depressed over the war losing everyone we care about\xe2\x80\xa6 and that she didn\'t even consider the consequences of her damn actions\xe2\x80\xa6 is that what you\'re telling me\xe2\x80\xa6""Well\xe2\x80\xa6 yeah I mean \xe2\x80\xa6 we couldn\'t exactly tell you nugget...since you were dealing with a lot of things\xe2\x80\xa6 and we didn\'t want to burden you with it,""Dealing with what exactly?""After the war\xe2\x80\xa6we lost a lot of people battling \xe2\x80\xa6we lost all sorts of people\xe2\x80\xa6 and then \xe2\x80\xa6 the raid of death eaters happen\xe2\x80\xa6 we lost Harry\xe2\x80\xa6 we lost Ron\xe2\x80\xa6 his wife Susan\xe2\x80\xa6 Ginny\xe2\x80\xa6 Seamus, Dean, Hannah and the rest of the Weasley\'s who were trapped in their own home in the Burrow being burned alive\xe2\x80\xa6 that we couldn\'t find anything but, their ashes\xe2\x80\xa6 they couldn\'t get out\xe2\x80\xa6 the death eaters were killing everyone from left to right \xe2\x80\xa6.everyone that we cared about\xe2\x80\xa6 mum\xe2\x80\xa6 daddy\xe2\x80\xa6 everyone\xe2\x80\xa6 you were practically an empty shell\xe2\x80\xa6 I barely recognize you and Jay after losing your other half \xe2\x80\xa6 I didn\'t know what to do\xe2\x80\xa6 you and Jay were\xe2\x80\xa6 going through so much and I didn\'t want to add that\xe2\x80\xa6 to the list\xe2\x80\xa6 it would\'ve \xe2\x80\xa6 made things worse\xe2\x80\xa6I\'m sorry\xe2\x80\xa6 you were practically blaming yourself when mum and daddy died\xe2\x80\xa6 while I had to make sure Georgie\xe2\x80\xa6 Freddie and Charlie were okay\xe2\x80\xa6 you guys were like\xe2\x80\xa6 I can\'t even \xe2\x80\xa6 describe how hard that was for me...I had to be the bigger person\xe2\x80\xa6 and it took a huge toll out of me that I couldn\'t even recognize my own husband\xe2\x80\xa6 since that\'s his family\xe2\x80\xa6 our family\xe2\x80\xa6 it just \xe2\x80\xa6 reminded me on how uncle Charlie lost his entire family when he was our age\xe2\x80\xa6 and it was hard on mum\xe2\x80\xa6 when they both lost their families thanks to those bastards\xe2\x80\xa6 the same monster\xe2\x80\xa6 who killed everyone\xe2\x80\xa6 that there\'s barely anyone left\xe2\x80\xa6 who we talk too\xe2\x80\xa6 I just\xe2\x80\xa6 I don\'t know how mum did it but, she did\xe2\x80\xa6 and I couldn\'t hold it together so \xe2\x80\xa6 I had to call uncle Charlie\xe2\x80\xa6 and told him what happen... ""Ariel\xe2\x80\xa6""Do you have any idea how hard it was to see my baby sister and our big brother\xe2\x80\xa6 heartbroken\xe2\x80\xa6 you were so depressed\xe2\x80\xa6 over Harry\'s death\xe2\x80\xa6 Ron\'s death\xe2\x80\xa6 Susan\'s\xe2\x80\xa6 Mr. and Mrs. Weasley\xe2\x80\xa6 Bill\xe2\x80\xa6 Fleur\xe2\x80\xa6 their children\xe2\x80\xa6 Percy\xe2\x80\xa6 Audrey\xe2\x80\xa6 Ginny\xe2\x80\xa6 Seamus\xe2\x80\xa6 Dean\xe2\x80\xa6 and Hannah\xe2\x80\xa6 with their children\xe2\x80\xa6 they\'re all dead\xe2\x80\xa6 because of it\xe2\x80\xa6 and you guys were having a hard time\xe2\x80\xa6 everyone that we lost\xe2\x80\xa6 it was hard for Jay and I \xe2\x80\xa6 we barely could recognize you cookie\xe2\x80\xa6we didn\'t know what to do to help you so I called uncle Charlie to help\xe2\x80\xa6but, he was dealing with his daughter who was also depress that time\xe2\x80\xa6 it was when Edward and her broke up\xe2\x80\xa6 that year\xe2\x80\xa6 he had to \xe2\x80\xa6 be strong for his daughter but, he didn\'t know what to do either.. He felt like he failed his own daughter\xe2\x80\xa6 and it was hard for him\xe2\x80\xa6 so I held whatever I felt and took care of you guys.\xe2\x80\xa6despite how Charlie, Fred, and George losing their entire family\xe2\x80\xa6 neither of us knew what to do\xe2\x80\xa6 Remus and Tonks are the only people who we rant worrying over you and we just\xe2\x80\xa6 felt like we failed to protect you...over the pain\xe2\x80\xa6""Ariel\xe2\x80\xa6.please stop\xe2\x80\xa6""You have to hear this nugget it\'s important\xe2\x80\xa6 okay I know you been through a lot \xe2\x80\xa6 babes we all did\xe2\x80\xa6 and I\'m sorry that we didn\'t you but, we were just trying to protect you\xe2\x80\xa6 we didn\'t want to burden you over this\xe2\x80\xa6 after what happen to Harry\xe2\x80\xa6 over the next pile of bad news\xe2\x80\xa6""But, that was my fault\xe2\x80\xa6.I would\'ve \xe2\x80\xa6 I could\'ve saved them\xe2\x80\xa6 from that fire\xe2\x80\xa6 the children\xe2\x80\xa6 they were screaming for me to save them\xe2\x80\xa6 Molly...

that...it\'s all my fault\xe2\x80\xa6" Hermione sobbed over her sister who rocked her back and forth to calm her her down."Shh\xe2\x80\xa6 I know you did everything you could baby girl and no, it\'s never your fault\xe2\x80\xa6 never \xe2\x80\xa6 ever think that at all\xe2\x80\xa6 if you did you could\'ve been killed too that day\xe2\x80\xa6 " Ariel began to say sob in return as she felt the same way, besides being 7 \xc2\xbd months pregnant hormones adding into the mix tends to do that "They protected us just like we protected them\xe2\x80\xa6 you did all you could baby girl\xe2\x80\xa6 mum and dad wouldn\'t blame you and I\'m pretty sure Arthur, Molly, Bill, Fleur, their children Victorie, Dominique, with their unknown baby brother or sister, Percy, Audrey, Molly, Lucy, Ginny, Seamus with their children, along with Fleur\'s parents and Gabriella would\'ve felt the same way they would\'ve told you it\'s not your fault\xe2\x80\xa6baby girl you can\'t keeping blaming yourself for that\xe2\x80\xa6 you can\'t save everyone\xe2\x80\xa6 they would\'ve understood why\xe2\x80\xa6it was just\xe2\x80\xa6 one of those things\xe2\x80\xa6 that \xe2\x80\xa6 no one can control\xe2\x80\xa6 it was their time to leave us despite how it\'s not in our plan to die early \xe2\x80\xa6 but, it was in god\'s plan\xe2\x80\xa6 not even you can do that\xe2\x80\xa6 we just have to accept that\xe2\x80\xa6 okay\xe2\x80\xa6" she drifted off causing Hermione sniffed slowly nod at this over Ariel\'s outfit while she kept rocking her back and forth to calm her down "Shh I know \xe2\x80\xa6 I know\xe2\x80\xa6 I miss them too\xe2\x80\xa6are you still angry with me for keeping this from you\xe2\x80\xa6 I\'m sorry if I did\xe2\x80\xa6 we were just protecting you\xe2\x80\xa6" she whispered kissing her sister on the forehead after a few minutes of silence."No\xe2\x80\xa6I\'m not angry\xe2\x80\xa6 not really\xe2\x80\xa6 I just\xe2\x80\xa6 I had no idea\xe2\x80\xa6 you felt that way ...it\'s a lot to take in \xe2\x80\xa6 that\'s all\xe2\x80\xa6""I know\xe2\x80\xa6but, it was how I felt\xe2\x80\xa6we both did\xe2\x80\xa6 since you had it worse then we did\xe2\x80\xa6but, knowing our dimwitted cousin \xe2\x80\xa6 she would\'ve twist the story when we arrive to Forks\xe2\x80\xa6 either way,"Hermione snorted at this wiping her tears quickly "Of course she would she\'s always been that selfish bitch," she spats in anger and huffed which Ariel nodded at this and sat down on the couch since Ariel is 7 \xc2\xbd months pregnant, feeling a bit tired as she sat down on the couch sipping some tea talking in low tones while Remus and Tonks grew quiet as they gave a silent conversation to leave them be and rushed over to the kids making sure they were alright since Hermione\'s magic did cause a small stir over the kids a bit.Hermione\'s P.O.V."Believe me nugget I know,""So, what are we going to do\xe2\x80\xa6 when we see her\xe2\x80\xa6""From what I heard from Leah she\'s visiting her mum in Florida for the whole summer before she heads back to school, so we won\'t be seeing her until maybe September or something,""Hmm\xe2\x80\xa6and how exactly did you and Jay knew find out about this\xe2\x80\xa6 Isabella living with uncle Charlie?"[no answer] \xe2\x80\xa6"Ariel\xe2\x80\xa6"[no answer] \xe2\x80\xa6"Ariel\xe2\x80\xa6""Aries Joelle Taylor Weasley I Swear to Merlin if you\'re trying to protect me I don\'t need any protection and\xe2\x80\x94" I hissed as her magic grew agitated and restless by Ariel who was cut out of her thoughts before her sister Hermione powers burst and we can\'t have that now can we?"A few years\xe2\x80\xa6 you just started your 6th year when you knew things got dangerous it was before you send us away \xe2\x80\xa6.to protect us \xe2\x80\xa6 so \xe2\x80\xa6it was before you and Harry decided to elope and had the small wedding""You and Jay this whole time that Isabella was staying with uncle Charlie and failed or even bothered to tell me about this and don\'t tell me it\'s to protect me because that\'s a load of bullocks Ariel," I cried out in anger.Ariel grew quiet knowing Hermione\'s magic aura was growing by the minute "Not at first I didn\'t know that our estrange cousin been staying with uncle Charlie until I heard from Leah around the year of September 2008 I assumed Isabella arrived in January 2007 2nd semester of her sophomore year in Forks High although from what Leah told me she didn\'t really like the fact that she has to deal with Isabella once again since they never got along as children to begin with, she didn\'t find out until she overheard her parents uncle Harry and auntie Sue that they heard from uncle Charlie that Isabella will be living with him only because her mum Renee was feeling a bit depressed so she went to join Phil her husband who\'s a baseball player on the road and that\'s when Isabella decided to stay with uncle Charlie despite their relationship being strained because of it. That was before you send us away to protect mum and dad during your 5th year Jay and Mal lived in Forks longer than I have\xe2\x80\x94maybe 5-6 years before they decided to live back in England\xe2\x80\x94that was when word got out of Isabella\'s arrival and all that," she drifted off noticing Hermione\'s eyes soften up a bit then harden over Isabella once more "And because we knew how you felt about her\xe2\x80\xa6 we all do\xe2\x80\xa6 while you guys we\'re dealing with Umbridge, losing our headmaster Albus, Sirius, Cedric\xe2\x80\xa6as we all know that the war gotten really dangerous by the end of your 6th year when I managed to get in touch with Leah, Rae and Bex by then," she argued back causing the sisters to be quiet "We didn\'t even knew where you guys half of the time\xe2\x80\x94because we all thought you\'d be in school but, that was before we learned about you and Harry being married secretly thanks to mum and dad; obviously it was a small ceremony but, it was there. By then everyone were all over the place trying to protect Harry and that\'s before Fred and George told us that you guys got attacked in Bill and Fleur\'s wedding reception causing you guys to separate from everyone \xe2\x80\xa6 with every death eaters hunting you guys down neither of them knew where you guys or knew that you guys were on a secret mission to hunt down horcruxes to destroy Voldemort and win the war," causing Hermione and Ariel both quiet once more that Hermione couldn\'t help but, flinch as she didn\'t want to think about the aftermath "By then neither of them except the family knew about the quints until you gave birth to them you practically begged us to protect the quints in case anything were to happen it was probably the hardest thing that every mother have to go through \xe2\x80\xa6 including you\xe2\x80\xa6I\'m sorry I kept it as a secret from you," she explained.Hermione steadied myself "I understand why you didn\'t want to tell me knowing how I felt about Isabella hurting uncle Charlie again. I was so close to killing that manipulative selfish two-timing bitch," she hissed at this causing Ariel to wince at this since Hermione never cusses which was never a good thing when it comes with the Gryffindor princess "But, what I don\'t understand Ariel is why didn\'t anyone especially you and Jay just tell me the truth I could\'ve handled it I\'m not a baby anymore," she pointed out.Ariel bowed her head in shame "I know you would Mia but, Jay and I thought it was going to burden you as if you didn\'t have enough to deal with during the war\xe2\x80\x94we just thought\xe2\x80\xa6 we\'d take care of the aftermath while you win the war in the Wizarding World protecting you is our job cookie... not the other way around... I just... you been through so much... after what happen to Harry" she whispered."Ariel\xe2\x80\xa6I know you guys mean well but, you have to realize I\'m not a baby anymore I should know what\'s going on with uncle Charlie\xe2\x80\xa6 with Sam, Leah, Jacob, Seth, uncle Billy, uncle Harry and auntie Sue along with everyone else. You can\'t protect me forever ya know," I explained."I know you\'re not a baby but, honestly Mia\xe2\x80\xa6 you were beginning to scare us\xe2\x80\xa6 making me remember the past of uncle Charlie when he lost auntie Aaliyah and the kids\xe2\x80\xa6 do you remember," Ariel began to say causing Hermione to hold her breath closing her eyes sadly remembering that memory in particular "It reminded me of that\xe2\x80\xa6 because you wouldn\'t eat\xe2\x80\xa6 sleep\xe2\x80\xa6it\'s like you were an empty shell\xe2\x80\xa6 not wanting to live anymore and that scared me to hell and even if we both told you the truth\xe2\x80\xa6 it would\'ve made things worse\xe2\x80\xa6 not just for you but, for us too\xe2\x80\xa6 neither of us wanted to burden you over this and as if you didn\'t have enough to deal with during the war\xe2\x80\x94we just thought\xe2\x80\xa6 we\'d take care of the aftermath while you win the war in the Wizarding World\xe2\x80\xa6we were protecting you\xe2\x80\xa6 the quints\xe2\x80\xa6 Harry\xe2\x80\xa6 Ron\xe2\x80\xa6 everyone that we love\xe2\x80\xa6 I can\'t even imagine how hard that was for you\xe2\x80\xa6and I\'m sorry we didn\'t tell you\xe2\x80\xa6 we wanted to protect you just like you wanted to protect us\xe2\x80\xa6" she whispered."And I get it\xe2\x80\xa6 I was ...I wasn\'t the same person \xe2\x80\xa6 after the war\xe2\x80\xa6 no one is\xe2\x80\xa6 I been through hell\xe2\x80\xa6 and back and \xe2\x80\xa6 I\'m sorry that I scared you guys\xe2\x80\xa6 I didn\'t mean too\xe2\x80\xa6 I just lost my husband\xe2\x80\xa6 it wasn\'t supposed to be like that\xe2\x80\xa6 Harry and I we-we made plans\xe2\x80\xa6 we were going to live in Forks, Washington raising our family\xe2\x80\xa6 he was going to build a small town around our property...only to find out that my husband Harry\xe2\x80\xa6 Ron\xe2\x80\xa6 Susan\xe2\x80\xa6 Mr. and Mrs. Weasley\xe2\x80\xa6 Bill.. Fleur\xe2\x80\xa6 the kids\xe2\x80\xa6 Percy\xe2\x80\xa6 Ginny\xe2\x80\xa6 Fleur parents and Gabriella along with everyone else\xe2\x80\xa6 that was our family\xe2\x80\xa6 are gone\xe2\x80\xa6 how can I \xe2\x80\xa6 move on without them here\xe2\x80\xa6 I miss them so much\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s not fair...thanks to those death eaters\xe2\x80\xa6 if things were reverse I would\'ve saved everyone\xe2\x80\xa6 so we can live together and live happily as we always planned\xe2\x80\xa6 that\'s when I realize\xe2\x80\xa6 I wasn\'t being a good mom to my kids\xe2\x80\xa6I knew then that I had to change \xe2\x80\xa6 I had to be brave for my kids sake\xe2\x80\xa6 I had to take everything that I ever felt aside so I can be the best mother that they ever had\xe2\x80\xa6but, it\'s so hard.." I explained."I know nugget believe me I know\xe2\x80\xa6 I may not know how it feels to lose a husband but, I lost my best friend\xe2\x80\xa6 I don\'t want to lose you either cookie neither me and Jay do\xe2\x80\xa6 uncle Charlie needs us \xe2\x80\xa6 he can\'t lose another family member\xe2\x80\xa6 " Ariel choked into her tears "Neither of us can\xe2\x80\xa6 which is why I think \xe2\x80\xa6 moving back home would help a lot\xe2\x80\xa6" she whispered."I know\xe2\x80\xa6 but, you should\'ve told me Ariel\xe2\x80\xa6 I could\'ve helped you\xe2\x80\xa6 you know I would\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s not the first time I lost someone I love\xe2\x80\xa6 and I guess it\'s just sucks again\xe2\x80\xa6 whenever I fall in love\xe2\x80\xa6 they end up dead\xe2\x80\xa6 within a year or two\xe2\x80\xa6I don\'t want us to keep secrets from each other okay\xe2\x80\xa6 no more secrets Ariel," I whispered."I know, I know and I\'m really sorry that we didn\'t tell you the truth cookie but, if Jay and I told you it would\'ve distracted you as we both know how overprotective we are with uncle Charlie\xe2\x80\xa6 and after what happen three years ago\xe2\x80\xa6 we didn\'t want to make things worse for you\xe2\x80\xa6 after you lost Harry and Ron with the rest of the Weasley\'s especially Harry\xe2\x80\xa6it\'s a lot to take in that burden after losing so many people that we cared about thanks to those death eaters\xe2\x80\xa6 I\'m so sorry cookie we just wanted to protect you," Ariel covered her mouth holding back her sob "I just \xe2\x80\xa6we didn\'t know what to do \xe2\x80\xa6it was really hard for Jay and I to keep that secret from you \xe2\x80\xa6 after what you guys went through\xe2\x80\xa6 we didn\'t want make things worse I promise no more secrets cookie bear," she whispered.Hermione cleared my throat rethinking this "Good and I\'ll do the same and your right\xe2\x80\xa6 I could\'ve been distracted which we couldn\'t afford that since when Harry, Ron and I were on the run, but, mostly we were on a secret mission from Dumbledore\xe2\x80\xa6 and I understand why you did it\xe2\x80\xa6 " she steadied her breathing to keep calm "So I\'m not faulting you on that\xe2\x80\xa6 so you stayed in touch with uncle Charlie then?" she explained."Thank you\xe2\x80\xa6 " Ariel held her sister close as they mumble comfort hugs after they quickly wipe their tears and grew serious "And I did\xe2\x80\xa6 Jay and I we had to make sure the death eaters didn\'t reach to America which thankfully they didn\'t as far as we know it didn\'t reach to America only around Europe but, they have heard of the war though\xe2\x80\xa6 at least in the wizarding communities," she explained."Well of course your my sister and I\'m glad it didn\'t reach America since they could\'ve have reached anything since I destroyed our families files before we left\xe2\x80\xa6 I saved all the documents inside this," I began to say showing her werewolf pendant and showed a flash drive "It\'s all in here I carried it in case for emergencies and inside my laptop so it\'s safe," she explained."In this flashdrive?" Ariel asked."Yes, it\'s all in here," Hermione began to say grabbing her lap top opening the documents through the flash drive showing all the families documents "I even saved mum and dad\'s business so it\'s safe I had Ruby\'s brother Robb to buy the dentistry under their names but, no one knows it\'s all ours," she explained.Ariel stared at her sister in disbelief looking at the family documents "Sweet mother Merlin you really thought of everything haven\'t you?""Well yes, I\'ve been planning for weeks way before Harry, Ron and I been on the run to destroy the horcruxes," Hermione shrugged closing the documents and took out the flash drive once it\'s safe to take out and put it away under her werewolf pendant necklace "I like to be prepared," she explained."Well it\'s a good thing you did and it would explain a lot but, Jay wanted to be extra sure and be cautious about the whole thing \xe2\x80\xa6 but, no death eaters haven\'t gone that far in America as far as I knew\xe2\x80\xa6""Brilliant\xe2\x80\xa6 so what about uncle Charlie\xe2\x80\xa6and I always thought Isabella hated Forks even as a child,""Uncle Charlie\'s fine just like the rest of our friends, our godparents they\'re all good\xe2\x80\xa6 trust me \xe2\x80\xa6 and Isabella does hate Forks she detest the town and never had a problem showing it \xe2\x80\xa6 thinks that uncle Charlie doesn\'t know but, he does he\'s not as stupid as she thinks and I suppose it changed the minute she decided to live with uncle Charlie in Forks... let\'s just say things changed\xe2\x80\xa6 it caught her attention\xe2\x80\xa6""Her attention\xe2\x80\xa6 what could possible grab her attention that made her like the place out of nowhere and what\'s that supposed to mean?""She\'s still that selfish bitch that doesn\'t appreciate anything around her but, herself and what brought her attention was\xe2\x80\xa6 that she has a boyfriend now,""A boyfriend\xe2\x80\xa6""Yes\xe2\x80\xa6""Hmm\xe2\x80\xa6and what\'s he like? The boyfriend I mean?""I know it\'s weird\xe2\x80\xa6 believe me I know this beforehand but, her boyfriend\xe2\x80\xa6 I never met the bloke but, from what Jay told me\xe2\x80\xa6 he looks exactly like-" Ariel sighed tiredly biting her bottom lip nervously grabbing the documents and put it inside her bag for safe keeping "Well you\'ll see when you see him from what I heard he\'s not exactly normal\xe2\x80\xa6 if that makes sense," she explained."Looks like who Ariel?... you\'re starting to scare me?""Mia\xe2\x80\xa6 I don\'t know how to say this but, I think when we arrive there you\'ll know what I mean\xe2\x80\xa6 it might \xe2\x80\xa6 give you a bit of a shock\xe2\x80\xa6 and I rather you know now since we\'re going to be living there this coming Friday but, from what Jay, Ariel and Ruby told me apparently Isabella is dating \xe2\x80\xa6 a vampire\xe2\x80\xa6"[no answer]..."Mia\xe2\x80\xa6?"[no answer]..."Mia?"[no answer] \xe2\x80\xa6"Hermione Anastasia Sophia Carson Jean Potter please answer me right now?!"Remus ran over to the empty library feeling the manor shaking a bit and said "What happen?""Nothing papa Remus\xe2\x80\xa6Mya\'s just in a bit of shock at the moment I got this,""Are you sure\xe2\x80\xa6?""I\'m positive make sure to protect the kids huh?"Remus raised his eyebrow at Ariel who waved him off and sighed "Will do\xe2\x80\xa6" he murmured under her breath until he heard-"ISABELLA MARIE SWAN IS DATING A WHAT?!" Hermione exclaimed causing Remus, Tonks and Ariel to wince at this as it echoed her office "IS SHE BLOODY CRAZY?!""Ah.. there you are\xe2\x80\xa6 I was beginning to get worried over here" Ariel murmured under her breath in French "Trust me Mia that\'s exactly what I told Jay when he learned what happen and he\'s not even that good looking," she snorted at this causing Hermione to raise her eyebrow at her sister considering they\'re both married "What? Just wait till you see him and I know I\'m happily married to Georgie and have beautiful children but, if things were reverse I still wouldn\'t go out with that bloke but, Georgie you know that so stop giving me that gawking look Mia," she explained."What about Sam Uley your first love,""Mya \xe2\x80\xa6 I told you not to mention him around me\xe2\x80\xa6""Well you did broke up with him when you were in middle school,""I know I did\xe2\x80\xa6 it was a mutual break up\xe2\x80\xa6""Sure\xe2\x80\xa6 that you were completely heartbroken when we move to England no less\xe2\x80\xa6 despite how you and Jay were attending in Salam Academy of Magic no less,""I know \xe2\x80\xa6. I don\'t regret it that decision \xe2\x80\xa6 it just made me realize we\'re not meant to be together\xe2\x80\xa6 and I\'m happy with George you know that,"Hermione flushed "I know you are and I\'m happy for you," she sighed at this sipping her tea "So how did they meet?""Who? George and I you already know how we met?""No, no not you guys I meant with Isabella and her boyfriend?""Oh\xe2\x80\xa6 right\xe2\x80\xa6 they met in school,""In school\xe2\x80\xa6 you mean to tell me the bloke that she\'s dating\xe2\x80\xa6 who\'s a vampire\xe2\x80\xa6 attends a muggle high school surrounded by humans where they could\'ve killed them by sucking their blood?""When you say it like that\xe2\x80\xa6 yes\xe2\x80\xa6 they been living in Forks for a few years\xe2\x80\xa6 his father is a doctor there everyone in town trust him?""A doctor\xe2\x80\xa6and everyone trust him even uncle Charlie,""Yes uncle Charlie is good friends with him\xe2\x80\xa6he\'s even allies with uncle Billy, uncle Harry and auntie Sue\xe2\x80\xa6along with Sam and his friends too\xe2\x80\xa6""Really\xe2\x80\xa6 isn\'t that a bit weird\xe2\x80\xa6 considering vampires drink human blood? And how is uncle Billy, uncle Harry, auntie Sue and Sam with his friends involve in this?""Dr. Cullen isn\'t that kind of vampire Mia and uncle Billy\'s family been living in Forks for a long time you remember those legends that he used to tell us as kids. It\'s all true,""What\'s all true?""The legends and Dr. Cullen being who they are\xe2\x80\xa6 they\'re known as the \'cold-ones\' if you can remember,""I remember the legends but, what kind of vampire is Dr. Cullen and his family are they?""They drink animal blood\xe2\x80\xa6 and his son \xe2\x80\xa6the one who\'s dating Isabella is an annoying selfish, meddling person that\'s what and can\'t mind his own business even in our family but, he can\'t help himself\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s not like he hasn\'t tried to control his powers" Ariel snorted at this "And when Jay told me this when he and Mal were living in Forks a few years ago I believe Logan, Zander, CJ & Sophia were only 8 years old when they moved back to England it\'s an adjustment really and while they were living there in Forks that\'s when Jay learned about Isabella living there with uncle Charlie. Obviously he hasn\'t left that time only because he and Tai are business partners so he pretty much heard everything what Isabella be doing during her time there. Jay and Mal were pretty busy making our home the best tourist place to visit and have a good time," she sighed sipping her tea "From what Jay told me he had to fix the mess that Isabella did especially saving uncle Harry during the hunt he nearly had a heart attack if it wasn\'t for Jay we would\'ve lost uncle Harry because of it," she explained."Hold on back up his family are vegetarian\xe2\x80\xa6 what vampire clan are they there\'s not a lot of vegetarian clans out there I should know I read about them?" I explained."I know... they drink animal blood not a lot of vampires can resist that kind of thing and their one of them""Well who is it?""Who is who?""The vampire clan that\'s living in Forks?""Ah\xe2\x80\xa6 that\xe2\x80\xa6 umm\xe2\x80\xa6 I haven\'t learned much\xe2\x80\xa6 except \xe2\x80\xa6 their names are\xe2\x80\xa6 the Cullens\xe2\x80\xa6that\'s the vampire clan\xe2\x80\xa6""WHAT?!" Hermione cried out in surprise causing Ariel to wince at this "THE CULLEN FAMILY they live in FORKS?!""Y-yo-you know about them?""Heard about them?!" Hermione snorted at this "Are you mental of course I have\xe2\x80\xa6Dr. Cullen and I are colleagues,..""Colleagues\xe2\x80\xa6 what do you mean you\'re colleagues?""Ariel\xe2\x80\xa6 he was one of the doctors that was working in St. Mungo\'s five years ago\xe2\x80\xa6due to a family emergency he decided to move back in America \xe2\x80\xa6 he\'s one of the respectful doctors in the country that most of the healers in St. Mungo\'s wouldn\'t be able to concentrate because of him. He looks quite young and very handsome from what Lulu told me good thing he\'s married or else they would\'ve followed him everywhere instead of doing their work,""Y-y-y-you met Dr. Cullen in St. Mungo\'s in England are you sure? And how come I didn\'t know about this,""Well\xe2\x80\xa6I didn\'t know he was a vampire that\'s for sure but, it must\'ve crossed my mind since I\'ve been busy with my life being a healer and \xe2\x80\xa6 he\'s very nice\xe2\x80\xa6 we\'re very good friends,""Good friends\xe2\x80\xa6 you do know he\'s married right?""Of course I do he also knows Harry they met a few times over the years,""Did they?""Mhmm\xe2\x80\xa6 we\'re all good friends with each other I just \xe2\x80\xa6 never connected the dots before no wonder he looked familiar \xe2\x80\xa6 and \xe2\x80\xa6 hold on what kind of trouble did they make in Forks?""Well there was some \xe2\x80\xa6 complication when Isabella first came to Forks?""What do you mean?""I mean\xe2\x80\xa6 that Edward\xe2\x80\xa6 that\'s the name of Isabella\'s boyfriend\xe2\x80\xa6 broke up with her during their junior year in high school after what happen in her birthday,""Hold on they broke up but, I thought they\'re together,""They are they got back together this past summer as if nothing has changed between them but, they did broke up for \xe2\x80\xa6 nearly a year\xe2\x80\xa6in their junior year\xe2\x80\xa6 in high school so I assume that\'s last year since uhh she\'s now in her final year... but, it was only 6-7 months and got back together last June\xe2\x80\xa6 when one of the Cullens came to visit...I believe it was Alice\xe2\x80\xa6 who came to visit and well\xe2\x80\xa6 there you go\xe2\x80\xa6 uncle Charlie isn\'t like it one bit\xe2\x80\xa6 because before they got together they rushed to Italy,""ITALY for what?""Because Edward thought Isabella died\xe2\x80\xa6 killed herself by jumping the cliff\xe2\x80\xa6.""Are you bloody serious\xe2\x80\xa6""As a heart attack,""And .. what exactly happened to her birthday that made Edward break up with her,""One of the vampires\xe2\x80\xa6 Jasper\xe2\x80\xa6 he \xe2\x80\xa6 may have lost control only because Isabella cut herself by opening one of her birthday presents and Edward freaked out\xe2\x80\xa6 said it was the only way to protect her because of Victoria another vampire who wanted to kill her because Edward killed her mate...the first year Isabella came back in Forks,""What? Is she alright?" Hermione gawked at this causing Ariel to slowly nod at this "Despite everything she\'s still our annoying selfish little cousin," she explained rolling her eyes."I know\xe2\x80\xa6." Ariel sighed pinching her nose "Believe me I don\'t want to be related to her but, sadly we are and she\'s such a drama queen it\'s rather annoying really" she explained."Tell me about it\xe2\x80\xa6 and what about uncle Harry is he alright?""Yes, yes, he\'s fine the doctors told him that he\'s going to be a strict diet so \xe2\x80\xa6 no more junk food for uncle Harry although he\'s still pouting but, he\'s thankful to be alive. Jay saved him just in time before he nearly died from a heart attack and Jay had to fix the mess with what Isabella\'s been doing from the past 3 \xc2\xbd years she\'s been living there,""Oh, thank bloody Merlin and how exactly would you know that\xe2\x80\xa6Isabella\'s boyfriend not good looking and what could she be possible be doing that would cause a lot of mess over the past 3 \xc2\xbd years she\'s been living in Forks Ariel,""It\'s bad\xe2\x80\xa6 from what I heard from Aqua\xe2\x80\xa6""What exactly did you find out Ariel?""I didn\'t find out much\xe2\x80\xa6until I talked to Leah only because she was dealing with \xe2\x80\xa6 other things in her life\xe2\x80\xa6""Leah? As in Leah Clearwater?""Yeah you remember her, don\'t you?""Of course, she\'s like a little sister to me being one of my brides maid in my wedding, how is she?"Ariel gave a painful expression "Oh she\'s great\xe2\x80\xa6."Hermione however, noticed her sister\'s expression turning to face her considering they\'re sitting on the couch "Ariel what\'s wrong? Leah is okay, right? I thought you said Jay saved uncle Harry from the hunt when he was living in Forks before"~*~End of Chapter Five~*~Whooooooo! I\'m done with Ch. 5 didn\'t take very long to update this chapter only because I have similar notes to the latest chapter that I stopped and added a few mixtures to the mix which you\'ll notice in each chapter. Did you notice that Henry\xe2\x80\x94Hermione\'s and Harry\'s youngest son picked that pacific wolf pack color like the Quileute wolf pack? I have a feeling it was pure non coincidences. Anyway, don\'t forget to read and review because I am on a roll! Ciao for now dolls!\nChapter Six: Hermione\'s Temper & Reaction!Her sister Ariel sighed giving a sad smile "He did save uncle Harry but, that\'s not why\xe2\x80\x94honestly she\'s\xe2\x80\x94Leah she\'s\xe2\x80\xa6 healing very slowly\xe2\x80\xa6 but, that\'s not why I\'m upset though\xe2\x80\xa6it\'s complicated\xe2\x80\xa6""Complicated\xe2\x80\xa6. How?""It\'s just complicated to talk about\xe2\x80\xa6""Ariel\xe2\x80\xa6 what is it?"[no answer] \xe2\x80\xa6"Ariel you can\'t expect me not to know about this she\'s one of my best friends and like a sister to me\xe2\x80\xa6 please..."Ariel sighed at this knowing how stubborn her sister is "Okay fine\xe2\x80\xa6 I\'ll tell you\xe2\x80\xa6 you remember Sammy\xe2\x80\xa6 right?""Sam Uley my childhood friend who happens to be your ex-boyfriend, your first love being my best friend of course considering he\'s like a brother to me\xe2\x80\xa6 he\'s the only person I ever trusted besides Jacob, Seth and Leah\xe2\x80\xa6 he\'s my best friend\xe2\x80\xa6 before I met Harry and Ron in Hogwarts considering they were invited to my wedding with Harry\xe2\x80\xa6 last time I checked he and Leah were happily dating and he was one of the groomsmen along with Jacob and Seth\xe2\x80\xa6what about him?"Ariel winced at this "Yes\xe2\x80\xa6 that\xe2\x80\xa6 besides being my first love\xe2\x80\xa6 Sam and Leah did date\xe2\x80\xa6 got engaged even after three years being together and set the date of the wedding once Leah graduates high school...getting ready for graduation \xe2\x80\xa6 her wedding was going to be planned within a year \xe2\x80\xa6 in the summer\xe2\x80\xa6 I was going to be the maid of honor it was supposed to be beautiful\xe2\x80\xa6 we have everything prepared\xe2\x80\xa6 the decorations\xe2\x80\xa6 the cake\xe2\x80\xa6 the food\xe2\x80\xa6 we even hired a dj instead of a band but, Leah insisted to get both courtesy of the Granger\'s family wedding gift for our goddaughter etc\xe2\x80\xa6" she drifted off sadly over her childhood best friend "During that summer\xe2\x80\xa6 when we were getting close to the wedding\xe2\x80\xa6 something happen\xe2\x80\xa6 if Jay and I didn\'t arrived when you send us away\xe2\x80\xa6 we really would\'ve lost uncle Harry nugget through a heart attack\xe2\x80\xa6 set the funeral for him\xe2\x80\xa6 and Leah would\'ve called off the wedding \xe2\x80\xa6 it would\'ve be this bad that changed everything for Leah as she is now\xe2\x80\xa6 that was before \xe2\x80\xa6 Leah told me what happen\xe2\x80\xa6 and I mean literally \xe2\x80\xa6 that made her call off the whole wedding off because of it," she explained.Hermione paled at this "Leah called off the wedding why? I thought they were in love?""They were in love\xe2\x80\xa6 at least that\'s what Leah thought\xe2\x80\xa6 until she \xe2\x80\xa6 " Ariel winced at this not wanting to reveal that part but, Hermione insisted so she made a small lie."Until she what?""She\xe2\x80\xa6 she\xe2\x80\xa6 walked in Sam\xe2\x80\xa6 cheating on her\xe2\x80\xa6 with her own cousin\xe2\x80\xa6 Emily\xe2\x80\xa6 they didn\'t even \xe2\x80\xa6 break up\xe2\x80\xa6 only because she had some news to tell him but, refused to tell him about it \xe2\x80\xa6 so she called off the wedding .. after she yelled, swore like a sailor her words not mind\xe2\x80\xa6 and ...cancelled everything\xe2\x80\xa6considering Emily is auntie\'s Sue\'s niece\xe2\x80\xa6.""Sammy did what?! Why would he do that?!" Hermione cried out in anger."Leah wouldn\'t say\xe2\x80\xa6 all I know it caused a lot of tension within the family because of it...there\'s all sorts of changes around Forks like chasing vampires, shapeshifters growing into werewolves\' pack\xe2\x80\xa6missing people in Seattle being turned into newborns vampires creating an army of vampire\'s kind of thing etc \xe2\x80\xa6people dying\xe2\x80\xa6.it\'s all mayhem and chaos because of it"Hermione widen her eyes in horror "Why would he do such a horrid thing," she swore in French under her breath "Why would Sammy do that to Leahbee I thought they love each other and what shapeshifters are you talking about?""They were in love but, apparently something changed\xe2\x80\xa6after Leah cool off\xe2\x80\xa6 although I was still in Forks then\xe2\x80\xa6.so I didn\'t hear much \xe2\x80\xa6 until I saw Sam\xe2\x80\xa6 he practically begged me to get Leah to reconsider to listen to him\xe2\x80\xa6 said he didn\'t have much of a choice...but, I told him you always have a choice \xe2\x80\xa6 no matter what you think\xe2\x80\xa6 and I may\'ve hexed him that left him to leave\xe2\x80\xa6 I didn\'t want to start anything with Sam\xe2\x80\xa6 but, breaking my best friend heart is where I draw the line... from what I can read from the reports from the American ministry thanks to Aqua and Ruby\xe2\x80\xa6 Sam and our childhood friends\xe2\x80\xa6 are shapeshifters \xe2\x80\xa6 not werewolves\xe2\x80\xa6 although there\'s different kinds so we won\'t get into that\xe2\x80\xa6 Sammy\xe2\x80\xa6 Leah bee\xe2\x80\xa6 Jacob\xe2\x80\xa6 Seth and their friends are the Quileute werewolf pack of shapeshifters,""Shapeshifters\xe2\x80\xa6 as in werewolves naturally without transforming under the moon kind of thing,""Yes, that would be it apparently the stories that uncle Billy told us are all true\xe2\x80\xa6 the legends of the Quileute pack are all true,""Bloody hell\xe2\x80\xa6 how?""Considering Sam and his friends\xe2\x80\xa6 are shapeshifters that would explain much\xe2\x80\xa6 Sam is the first to transform...then Jared Cameron\xe2\x80\xa6 Paul Lahote\xe2\x80\xa6 Embry Call\xe2\x80\xa6 then Jacob Black\xe2\x80\xa6 Leah and Seth Clearwater, Quil Ateara\xe2\x80\xa6.being the last ones then there\'s two others ones Brady and Collin their the youngest in the pack,""Sweet mother of Merlin you mean the legends that uncle Billy used to tell us as kids\xe2\x80\xa6 so that means the \'cold-ones\' are \xe2\x80\xa6 a different names for the Cullens being vampires\xe2\x80\xa6 is that \xe2\x80\xa6 also true,""Yes\xe2\x80\xa6""Bloody hell\xe2\x80\xa6 and this all happen from the past three years,""Yeah it did\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s a lot I know\xe2\x80\xa6""But, but, but, is that why Sam and Leah broke up because of\xe2\x80\xa6 the werewolf pack\xe2\x80\xa6""Not exactly\xe2\x80\xa6" Ariel winced at this not wanting to reveal much "You\'re going to have to ask Sam about that,"Hermione\'s eyes harden at this "Oh believe me I will\xe2\x80\xa6" she growled causing Ariel to wince from her tone of voice and then steadied her voice to calm herself down "And you always have a choice\xe2\x80\xa6 I don\'t understand why Sammy would do this since I was the one that picked her engagement ring\xe2\x80\xa6that was from-nana gave it to me\xe2\x80\xa6 she said that I should give it to Sam\xe2\x80\xa6 it was his last gift from nana \xe2\x80\xa6 while I keep the pendant\xe2\x80\xa6 I just don\'t understand why he\'d-" she sighed tiredly pinching her nose as she\'ll have a word with Sam when she gets home "I can understand that he didn\'t want to be with Leah but, the least he could\'ve done was\xe2\x80\xa6 tell Leah the truth\xe2\x80\xa6 she deserved that much\xe2\x80\xa6 and who\'s-who\'s Emily? I don\'t think I ever met an Emily in Forks before?" she explained."She\'s Leah\'s and Seth\'s cousin from auntie Sue\'s family side of the family...""Are you bloody kidding me...""No I\'m not kidding and she never lived in Forks she lived in a different reservation until she came to visit during Leah\'s engagement party that time Emily was part of the bridal party when she decided to move in Forks and that\'s when things\xe2\x80\xa6 started to uh get complicated and she\'s \xe2\x80\xa6 Leah\'s and Seth\'s cousin through auntie Sue\'s family side\xe2\x80\xa6"Hermione paled "You\'re kidding\xe2\x80\xa6" she began to say causing Ariel to shake her head at this "Bloody hell and Sam just cheated on her with Emily\xe2\x80\xa6 just like that\xe2\x80\xa6 he didn\'t even consider Leah\'s feelings at all\xe2\x80\xa6"Ariel winced at this "Well.. Leah told me that it was\xe2\x80\xa6 very complicated she was a bit bitter when we talked\xe2\x80\xa6 and I managed to talk to her after Rae and Bex failed to try to get Leahbee to open up until I came to visit uncle Charlie when we were in the middle of the war\xe2\x80\xa6 she wouldn\'t tell me why at first because she was so heartbroken\xe2\x80\xa6 so I may have dug a little more information thanks to Aqua and Ruby\'s help and \xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s a whole lot of mess thanks to Isabella\xe2\x80\xa6"Hermione felt saddened over her little sister and hopes when she gets home she\'ll help Leah move on with her life away from Sam "Poor Leahbee\xe2\x80\xa6I wish there was something I can do and what exactly did Isabella do \xe2\x80\xa6 that got herself involved in this?"Ariel soften her eyes "I know nugget and I\'m pretty sure Leah will appreciate the help after all we\'re her adopted sisters and godmother it\'s our job to protect her even from guys like Sam\xe2\x80\xa6 I\'m pretty sure she needs a sisterly hug," she sighed as her eyes narrowed at their estranged cousin Isabella "And I\'m getting to that \xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s all sorts of things really\xe2\x80\xa6 do you remember when you, Harry and Ron were in a run hunting for horcruxes no one knew about the mission except you three and Albus\xe2\x80\xa6 during the war\xe2\x80\xa6""I hope so and I will get to the bottom of this \xe2\x80\xa6 because that doesn\'t sound like Sammy that I grew up at all \xe2\x80\xa6 he\'s not the same person that I once knew\xe2\x80\xa6and if that\'s true...then he doesn\'t deserve that ring\xe2\x80\xa6 it was supposed to be Leah\'s engagement ring\xe2\x80\xa6 that\'s nana\'s I want it back I\'m going to get it back""Nobody is\xe2\x80\xa6 we had to grow up sometime\xe2\x80\xa6 that includes Sammy nugget and I\'m sure\xe2\x80\xa6 he\'ll be willing to give it back \xe2\x80\xa6 once you guys talk\xe2\x80\xa6 and all\xe2\x80\xa6""Oh\xe2\x80\xa6 I\'m far from going to talk to him\xe2\x80\xa6 but, I\'ll deal with that later\xe2\x80\xa6 and I know but, from what he told me at my wedding he said he couldn\'t wait to marry Leah, gain a family of their own with a plan of their own and now all of a sudden he\'s in love with this Emily person\xe2\x80\xa6 who the bloody hell does she thinks she is breaking up Sam and Leah\'s relationship and I don\'t even know her\xe2\x80\xa6 and I\'m already hating her\xe2\x80\xa6 unbelievable," Hermione scoffed at this "What else did you find out?" she explained.Ariel grew quiet "I don\'t know\xe2\x80\xa6 what brought Sam to do that I really don\'t\xe2\x80\xa6" she lied."Leah never told you?""She only said it\'s complicated\xe2\x80\xa6""I can see that but, what about when I was in the mission with Harry and Ron? It\'s not like I can forget about it...since it\'s been mentioned\xe2\x80\xa6 a few times over the years\xe2\x80\xa6""Right\xe2\x80\xa6 sorry\xe2\x80\xa6 well there\'s more to the story Mia\xe2\x80\xa6 while you were on the run \xe2\x80\xa6 Jay and I \xe2\x80\xa6 were separated I would watch over mum and dad making sure the death eaters didn\'t follow us while Jay stayed in Forks to be near uncle Charlie\xe2\x80\xa6 so technically Jay stayed there for more than six years in Forks before Isabella decided to live in Forks-it was that same year that Isabella arrived to Forks- by then Jay and Mal decided to move back to England however, Jay\'s friends who stayed behind would give him reports about our estrange cousin who\'s been causing all kinds of ruckus of trouble in Forks that\'s not even close to what I\'m going to do with her after what happen in Italy\xe2\x80\x94he still keeps in touch with Mikko by the way he says hi but, he\'s not that sweet kid that you used to babysit he\'s a bit cocky now" Ariel murmured causing Hermione to instantly flinched "By then you, Harry, and Ron were already gone during your final year in Hogwarts but, instead of going to Hogwarts like you\'re supposed to \xe2\x80\xa6 it was when the second war in the Wizarding World became really dangerous\xe2\x80\xa6 after Albus Dumbledore got killed\xe2\x80\xa6""Ariel what are you talking about? What happen in Italy? And Mikko what happened to Mikko?""I\'m saying that when Isabella arrived in her sophomore year\xe2\x80\xa6 she arrived in January 17th, 2007 by then you and Harry were already married for the second time except by then you guys gained children\xe2\x80\x94quints to be exact do you remember? And don\'t worry about Mikko he\'s fine\xe2\x80\xa6 he\'s just a bit cocky you know how high school kids are,""Ariel\xe2\x80\xa6 Harry and I married twice \xe2\x80\xa6 because we couldn\'t exactly have a honeymoon due to the war, so we eloped in our 6th year no one knew about it so we waited until after the war ended which is why we both decided to have a grand wedding for us with our love ones and that was like\xe2\x80\xa6 nearly 5 years ago\xe2\x80\xa6and what happened to Mikko? He is alright right?""I know you guy did considering I was the maid of honor at the wedding and Mikko\'s fine he\'s just\xe2\x80\xa6 dating one of the town folks\xe2\x80\xa6 Jessica Stanley don\'t like her though she\'s a bit \xe2\x80\xa6 cheery for my taste and bitchy but, you\'ll know what I mean," Ariel murmured."Who\'s Jessica and sweet Godric-Ariel you\'re doing it again,""Doing what?""Changing the subject what is going on \xe2\x80\xa6 what happened in Italy\xe2\x80\xa6""Mikko\'s girlfriend," Ariel snarled at this who rapidly changed the subject again "I don\'t like her,"Hermione raise her eyebrow at this "Ariel\xe2\x80\xa6.""Sorry\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s just I don\'t like her?...""Okay\xe2\x80\xa6 and why do you not like her again?""She\'s exactly like Isabella except cheerier and a bit bitchy,""That\'s a bit harsh don\'t you think?""Just wait till you meet her Mia, she\'s like the biggest gossip queen in all Forks along with this other girl Lauren Mallory I think that\'s her name their horrible muggles and let\'s not forget a big bully,"Hermione frowned at this "You\'re kidding, please\xe2\x80\xa6 tell me you\'re kidding,""No, I wish I wasn\'t but, I\'m not kidding Mia,""Bloody hell why would Mikko go out with her for if she\'s bullying people?""I bet it\'s because of her chest and I honestly don\'t think Mikko knows that she\'s bullying people""Her chest\xe2\x80\xa6and why wouldn\'t he know about this""Yes\xe2\x80\xa6 her chest\xe2\x80\xa6I would say ...because he\'s too in love with our dimwitted cousin Isabella to care""Why would Mikko\xe2\x80\x94" Hermione pinched her nose at this "So let me get this straight\xe2\x80\xa6 Mikko is dating Jessica Stanley huh and in love with Isabella? Is she muggle or what?""Yes, she\'s muggle as Mikko but, I honestly don\'t think you\'re going to get along with her?""Ugh\xe2\x80\xa6 I can tell and I don\'t even know her or met her yet but, what about this Lauren Mallory person?""I didn\'t hear much about her but, she was dating this Tyler bloke but, they broke up apparently they have the same friends\xe2\x80\xa6 Mikko I mean \xe2\x80\xa6 ""So, I\'m guessing Mikko is a popular bloke then?""Something like that\xe2\x80\xa6 and he used to have huge feelings for Isabella and still does but, acts that he\'s not into her but, apparently he is,""Ewe why would he like Isabella she\'s not even pretty?!""Beats me and I honestly don\'t see why guys would be into Isabella when she doesn\'t have any hobbies all she wants to be with-" Ariel stopped mid-sentence and rapidly changed the subject "And that was only five years ago ...while Isabella arrived to Forks for Merlin knows what while the rest of us were fighting for our lives in the Second Wizarding War, she doesn\'t know the first thing of loving uncle Charlie because all she does is breaking his heart," she spats causing Hermione\'s eyes turned harden over this "She\'s too selfish and a bitch to even care about anything but, herself and her precious boyfriend of hers," she explained with a sneer."Well\xe2\x80\xa6 I suppose I\'ll have to see since Mikko is one of my best friends\xe2\x80\xa6but, why in Merlin would he have feelings for Isabella she\'s not even that attractive to have a boyfriend to begin with," Hermione snorted at this by rolling her eyes at this notion "But, that\'s besides the point since we both know Isabella is too selfish to even care about uncle Charlie but, herself Ariel," she spats in anger "And I know there\'s more to this story isn\'t there. What exactly happen in Italy Ariel because Merlin knows we should fix damage control because of her,""Don\'t even worry about it I asked Blaise to help out and he gave me copies on what happen with the Volturi,""The Volturi," Hermione widen her eyes in horror "How are the Volturi involved in this and why would you ask Blaise for help over the Volturi-they\'re \xe2\x80\xa6. Like the royal court Volturi?""Yes\xe2\x80\xa6""Ariel.. Do you not realize how dangerous they are,""Believe me I know\xe2\x80\xa6 how do you think Blaise and I fix the damage thanks to our dimwitted cousin who ruined the ceremony?""Ceremony?""Mhmm?""What ceremony?""The one in Italy,""Stop changing the subject Ariel what ceremony in Italy just tell me\xe2\x80\xa6""Trust me they\'re more than involved and the only reason I asked Blaise is because his family has connections to the Italian Ministry so I thought considering he\'s our good friend, our brother in-law sort of and I knew he can help since he knows people that has been watching over Isabella\'s ever move so they\'re more involved than you think and we needed more recruits in case we needed help over the war,""Oh\xe2\x80\xa6 well I supposed that helps a bit \xe2\x80\xa6 and how are they involved again since I\'m friends with Aro\xe2\x80\xa6 sort of\xe2\x80\xa6 not exactly close but, we\'re allies,""YOUR WHAT?!""Well\xe2\x80\xa6 yes\xe2\x80\xa6 he-he\xe2\x80\xa6 he was the guest sponder in my 6th year and-" Hermione began to say noticing Ariel pale look "What? Why are you looking at me that?""Your friends with Aro?""Yes\xe2\x80\xa6 kind of\xe2\x80\xa6 why?""You just said it yourself that their dangerous Mia and you\'re friends with them why would you do that?""Well\xe2\x80\xa6 how am I supposed to know that our dimwitted cousin was involved since no one failed to mention that until now,""I said I was sorry\xe2\x80\xa6" Ariel pouted at this."Yes, yes, I realize that but, what does have to do with me being friends with Aro?""Mia\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s everything since Aro and his clan doesn\'t know anything about us on how powerful we are or that we\'re related to Isabella until \xe2\x80\xa6 Jay told him about it\xe2\x80\xa6 it didn\'t exactly help much but, the Cullens and our dimwitted cousin are in the clear\xe2\x80\xa6 for now\xe2\x80\xa6""I don\'t care tell me anyway and I don\'t understand how Isabella is involved with the Volturi who\'s dating a bloody vampire \xe2\x80\xa6 despite everything Ariel \xe2\x80\xa6 she\'s still our family\xe2\x80\xa6 I\'m not saying we have to like the girl or get along with her Merlin knows I want to strangle the bitch and as much as I agree with you\xe2\x80\xa6 she\'s still a selfish bitch since I can remember that I would love to kill her \xe2\x80\xa6 but, she\'s the only family we have left besides uncle Charlie\xe2\x80\xa6" Hermione argued back."You\'re right she is our cousin but, honestly she\'s already in thin-very thin ice with Jay and I \xe2\x80\xa6 that I hardly think she\'s not thinking of the bloody consequences over this and-" Ariel stopped noticing Hermione\'s cold icy look "Okay\xe2\x80\xa6okay\xe2\x80\xa6 because believe me I told Jay this and he agreed... when I heard what she did Jay was pissed\xe2\x80\xa6.it doesn\'t change anything with us\xe2\x80\xa6 since she\'s already in thin ice with us\xe2\x80\xa6 and I just don\'t appreciate what she\'s doing causing all sorts of trouble in Forks and I\'m getting to that Mia\xe2\x80\xa6I just need you to be calm that\'s all..." she sighed knowing her sister is right "The Volturi are involved because they\'re good friends with Carlisle Cullen the head of the Cullen\'s clan,""I am calm\xe2\x80\xa6 remember and who?""Okay good\xe2\x80\xa6 because you need to be calm since the Cullens are known from the the Olympic clan from Washington? The one that Dr. Cullen is in that\'s his clan""Hold on \xe2\x80\xa6 Dr. Cullen is the \xe2\x80\xa6 Head of the Clan of the Olympic clan \xe2\x80\xa6 the vegetarians vampires who drink animal blood the one that I met five years ago?""Yes\xe2\x80\xa6"Hermione paled and swore under her breath "Sweet mother of Godric I\'m a bloody idiot\xe2\x80\xa6 no wonder he looks so familiar\xe2\x80\xa6" she began to say murmur under her breath "They\'re one of the respected clans\xe2\x80\xa6 in the country aren\'t they?""They are...and three of his adopted children-Jasper Hale, his mate Alice Cullen and Edward Cullen have powers?""Powers\xe2\x80\xa6?""Mhmm\xe2\x80\xa6""What kind of powers\xe2\x80\xa6""Jasper\xe2\x80\xa6 he can control emotions\xe2\x80\xa6empathy""And Alice\xe2\x80\xa6?"Ariel sighed tiredly "She\'s a physic she can see the future""Ewe\xe2\x80\xa6 ""I know you hate them and never liked division because of it,""I do\xe2\x80\xa6 and still do what about this Edward bloke?""He can read people\'s thoughts without their consent?""You\'re kidding,""Nope\xe2\x80\xa6it\'s one of the reasons that I don\'t get along with him because he can\'t help himself by reading people\'s thought so you should watch out from him. He n ever learned how to control his powers and he\'s only what\xe2\x80\xa6 145 years old...not exactly rocket science to hate the bloke""Oh believe me I will I can see why you hate him which makes me hate him more and I never met the bloke yet\xe2\x80\xa6 and what about Esme\xe2\x80\xa6 Rosalie and Emmett..?""Good and neither of them don\'t have any powers... the only ones that I read was that Esme is like a mother hen towards her children, Rosalie is just pretty and Emmett is just the muscles or something?""Hmm\xe2\x80\xa6 and yet you don\'t like them at all,""Well I get along with Dr. Cullen and his wife Esme I met them in Forks when I was staying there that one summer before I left but, I never associate with their adopted children\xe2\x80\x94Jasper Hale, Rosalie Hale, Alice Cullen, Emmett Cullen and Edward Cullen not in the slightest,""Do you not like them at all Ariel?""Well I suppose if we\'re going to be living there within four days\xe2\x80\xa6 I probably get along with Jasper, Rosalie and Emmett for sure not so much for Alice or Edward,""How come?""Honestly \xe2\x80\xa6 from what Aqua told me \xe2\x80\xa6 since she met this Alice girl she\'s a bit perky and a bit weird but, that\'s not why I don\'t like her\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s more of her personality and she\'s best friends with Isabella they do everything together,""Hmm\xe2\x80\xa6 and why do I have a feeling I\'m missing something out of this? And what about Edward?""Edward," Ariel bitterly snorted at this "He\'s just annoying. He can\'t seem to control his powers by reading people\'s thoughts without their consent just wait till you meet them Mia and you\'ll get your chance on knowing them like I did although back then they never see who I really was\xe2\x80\xa6 I had a different disguise when I met them and I immediately didn\'t like Alice or Edward at all,""Well alright then\xe2\x80\xa6so how exactly is Isabella involved with the Cullens and the Volturi again?" Hermione repeated to my sister Ariel.Ariel sighed waving her hand as I assumed she\'s putting a silent charm around her office then back to the library back at the manor "I told you\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s complicated to explain and even if I did you\'re going to have to talk to Jay since he knows most of the details than I do," she explained."But, why can\'t you just tell me Ariel?" Hermione pleaded at this "I\'m not a kid anymore so you have to stop treating me like one,""I know baby girl I\'m just protective with you and as much as I hate the girl\xe2\x80\xa6 she\'s nothing but, a trouble magnet Mia I\'m telling you\xe2\x80\xa6""I know and I don\'t bloody care she\'s our cousin\xe2\x80\xa6 despite what she did\xe2\x80\xa6 you need to tell me the truth and I mean everything,"Ariel sighed "Alright but, you\'re not going to like it\xe2\x80\xa6" she began to say but, noticed Hermione\'s stern look that left her to give in "Okay...okay\xe2\x80\xa6you really do like mum when you do that you know\xe2\x80\xa6" she began to say causing me to have a small smile "From what Jay told me\xe2\x80\xa6in their junior year... Edward and Isabella broke up\xe2\x80\xa6 she didn\'t take the break up very well\xe2\x80\xa6 became a zombie for about 6-7 months\xe2\x80\x94" she drifted off with a distant look then sighed tiredly "From what Jay told me she was in her zombie state for a while\xe2\x80\xa6it worried sick uncle Charlie scared shitless that he offered to buy a ticket to Florida to be with her mother Renee which made Isabella snap at him," she scowled that I couldn\'t help but, pinch my nose in annoyance knowing Isabella attitude "There was another vampire who was hunting our estrange cousin Isabella because the Cullens killed James was her mate. Her name was Victoria\xe2\x80\xa6the one that I told you about who\'s after our cousin\xe2\x80\xa6 as far as I know she\'s creating new-born vampires to kill the Cullens and Isabella for revenge because of it\xe2\x80\xa6 the way from what I heard Jay told me is that there was some trouble... James who\'s a hunter was from a different clan\xe2\x80\xa6 it was only him, Victoria and Laurent who drink human blood\xe2\x80\x94but, the Cullens killed James because he caught the scent of Isabella and became to hunt her as his next meal which didn\'t sit well with Edward and got killed by Emmett Cullen and Jasper Hale; Edward\'s brothers\xe2\x80\x94by then Isabella was bitten on the wrist by James because she thought he had Renee captured but, turned out he lied so Edward had no choice but, to suck out the venom out of her before they rushed her to the hospital," she explained.Hermione\'s P.O.V."Are you serious," I stared at my sister in disbelief over our estrange cousin Isabella "Why would she\xe2\x80\x94" and swore under her breath."Exactly Mia I told you she\'s nothing but, trouble," Ariel scowled "And I just don\'t appreciate what she\'s doing\xe2\x80\xa6 she\'s hurting uncle Charlie\xe2\x80\xa6 all she cares about is only Edward\xe2\x80\xa6 and not even caring\xe2\x80\xa6 about anyone else but, him\xe2\x80\xa6 that\'s it," she explained."Are you bloody kidding me that\'s horrible\xe2\x80\xa6 no wonder uncle Charlie was worried but, I don\'t blame you for being angry at her I would have felt the same way," I cried out in protest "How many are there that are after our dimwitted cousin do you know?""No, I don\'t know the amount of trouble she is in yet but, Aqua\'s going to find out as soon as she gets back from Italy and see what she can find out,""Good\xe2\x80\xa6" I pinched her nose in annoyance "How many do you think they built in the army I mean?""As far as I know maybe\xe2\x80\xa6 200 maybe more they won\'t have enough to defeat them unless Sam and the pack help,""And how did Victoria end up wanting revenge against our cousin?""The only reason \xe2\x80\xa6 she\'s out for revenge is because Edward killed James her mate\xe2\x80\xa6she has red hair with curls and thinks if she killed Isabella it would make Edward felt the same pain that she did\xe2\x80\xa6 or something around there and we also have the Volturi to consider as well,"Hermione instantly stiffen over this "Oh really?" she gave a drawl tone which isn\'t a good thing "And how exactly did that happen again?""When the Cullens invited Isabella on a baseball game when she first arrived back in Forks to live with uncle Charlie\xe2\x80\xa6 I believe she was in her sophomore year that time and got into trouble with another \xe2\x80\xa6 vampire clan\xe2\x80\xa6 although I\'m not sure what happened on that time you have to ask Jay about it,""Isabella doesn\'t like sports, and do you remember how she\'s always complaining how it\'s not even fun without even tripping over the damn thing and trust me I will ask him when I see him at the zoo with the kids,""Trust me I know Merlin knows why they did but, Jay heard a rumor that it helps with the lightning whatever that means,""That\'s just weird but, whatever so\xe2\x80\xa6 how did exactly Isabella got involved with the vampire of hers,""From what uncle Charlie told me they met during school-I assume Edward tried to read her mind and couldn\'t find a reading which drove him frustrated and tried to warn her to stay away from him which didn\'t work because she always ends up getting herself in trouble\xe2\x80\xa6 always \xe2\x80\xa6 drawing herself in trouble and I assume Edward couldn\'t help himself\xe2\x80\xa6 and fell in love \xe2\x80\xa6 over time after she \xe2\x80\xa6 " Ariel explained with a scoff."After she what?""She flirted with Jacob to get more information which she put two-two together after a few weeks when she confronted him on what he was\xe2\x80\xa6 and since they couldn\'t stay from each other they ended up \xe2\x80\xa6together and confirmed their relationship in school,""She flirted with Jacob to get information about the Cullens,""Yep\xe2\x80\xa6""And it worked?""Well in Jacob\'s defense he didn\'t know\xe2\x80\xa6 it was before he became a wolf\xe2\x80\xa6 a shape shifter as a werewolf yes,""And then what happen?""That\'s when Edward and Isabella proclaimed their relationship in public in school\xe2\x80\xa6 they pretty much do everything together and that\'s how they ended up going to a baseball game; that\'s when James, Victoria and Lauret came along?""Who?""The other vampire clan\xe2\x80\xa6 who\'s been killing the muggles in town which cause a stir for Dr. Cullen and his family they weren\'t aware they made a claim in town that time,"Hermione slowly nod at this "I see\xe2\x80\xa6 and how does that the Cullen family feel about her?""Aqua told me they get along quite nicely but, Jasper and Rosalie they don\'t feel like connected with her because they didn\'t want her to be involved but, it\'s debatable argument. I also should mention that there\'s some\xe2\x80\xa6 complication between Isabella and the Cullen\'s family,""What kind of complication?""Alice had a vision stating that she\'d be a vampire\xe2\x80\xa6 into their family\xe2\x80\xa6which is why the Volturi is against this\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s either that or kill her for knowing to much but, Alice managed to convince them that she\'ll be one of them\xe2\x80\xa6 that\'s one of the reasons why\xe2\x80\xa6 they\'re \xe2\x80\xa6 planning on turning her which is against the treaty they had with the Quileute Tribe or death,"By then Hermione\'s lips curled with a sneer, obviously Draco, Blaise, Theo and Pansy are being bad influence over their little sister but, that\'s a different manner as she grabbed the books about vampires-there\'s some information of the Cullen family "Oh really this is the same Cullen family from years ago... and what treaty are you talking about?""Yes, the same one Mia they even made a treaty with uncle Billy and his pack well his ancestors of Jacob\'s grandfather who was the Alpha that time-The Quileute pack I mean so they\'ve been allies for a long time but, since Isabella is involved it\'s causing a lot of tension between them,""Bloody hell\xe2\x80\xa6.so, are you telling me that not only that this Victoria person is after our dimwitted selfish greedy cousin Isabella who\'s creating an army of newborn vampires running off creating a huge mess of things but, we also have the Volturi involved and made a treaty with Sam with his pack-the Quileute pack years ago before Sam and his friends were involved?""Yes, and there\'s also some trouble with the Quileute wolf pack\xe2\x80\x94Sam and his pack being shapeshifters as they made a treaty years ago when Jacob\'s grandfather was the head of his pack back in the day\xe2\x80\x94the treaty states if the Cullens were to bite a human to become a vampire the treaty will be treason meaning they\'ll be in war with the Quileute pack because of it and will kill every single one in the Cullen family including our cousin since she\'s the reason why there\'s tension in the air because of it"Hermione pinched her nose grumbling under her breath in French "You don\'t have to tell me twice\xe2\x80\xa6 why exactly is the Volturi involved though?""It\'s because Edward and Isabella\'s relationship, being human\xe2\x80\x94" Ariel pointed out "It\'s not very common unless she\'s his mate then that\'s a different story\xe2\x80\xa6 but, from what I heard from Ruby she said that Isabella made a huge mess in Italy ruining their holiday which we will get that soon and it was against the vampire laws to fall in love with a human that Ruby and the rest of us had to fix the damages because of it,""How much damage can she possibly be doing from the past 3 \xc2\xbd years,""If only you knew Mia if only you knew,""Tell me anyway,"So Ariel did tell Hermione what happen after she put a silent charm around her office, she began to explain how Isabella arrived, got curious about the Cullens, flirted with Jake to get information despite how he didn\'t know it then\xe2\x80\x94how she met the Cullen family, how Rosalie Hale doesn\'t like their cousin, Jasper as well since he doesn\'t talk to her much\xe2\x80\xa6 and then there\'s how they went to a baseball game together where they met another vampire clan\xe2\x80\x94James, Victoria and Laurent then came to the hunt prey, how they tried to get Isabella out of town but, they couldn\'t exactly leave their uncle Charlie unprotected unfortunately Esme and Rosalie kept watch over their uncle much to Hermione\'s relief but, swore and seething over their estrange cousin behavior then the break up between Edward and Isabella happen, their cousin became a zombie over their break up not taking it well, then she and Jacob started to hang out then things started to happen,Jacob became a shapeshifter (a.k.a. werewolf) as he claimed he fell in love with her and been extra moody when he found out that Isabella picked Edward over Jacob despite how she\'s toying and using him\xe2\x80\x94how they almost lost their godfather Harry Clearwater but, thanks to Jay he saved him during the police patrol.How Isabella went with Alice to Italy to save Edward because he thinks Isabella\'s dead because of a vision from Alice who saw her jump a cliff where she went cliff diving which was false, then that\'s where Ariel explained the Italy fiasco with the Volturi, if they broke up not wanting to be together they would\'ve killed her because humans aren\'t supposed to know about the magical world unless it was necessary\xe2\x80\x94then Alice claimed that she saw Isabella as one of them\xe2\x80\x94a vampire like the Cullens where Edward explained to Isabella how he tried to track down Victoria for hunting Isabella unprotected etc. Hermione held a blank expression on her face when she listened to Ariel\'s story about the whole thing especially when her childhood best friend Sam Uley and Leah Clearwater break up due to unknown reasons; she had a feeling Ariel is hiding something from her but, she\'ll deal with it later."That inconsiderate selfish no good two timing daft bitch are you telling me from the past 3 1/2 years since she\'s been living in Forks it\'s been nothing but, trouble to another," I hissed and gasps feeling a bit sympathy over Jacob having his heart broken shaking her head which Ariel nodded in each sentence "Unbelievable it would seem she hasn\'t changed," she snorted at this "What else could possibly go wrong,"Ariel winced at this "Well\xe2\x80\xa6.that\'s not even half of it Mia\xe2\x80\xa6do you remember when I told you when uncle Charlie was worried sick over Isabella during her break up with Edward from the past 7 months in their junior year\xe2\x80\xa6""Yes but, you failed to mention to tell me the whole story though?""Right\xe2\x80\xa6 during her junior year\xe2\x80\xa6 during their break up\xe2\x80\xa6 Isabella thought that she was coming along with Edward and his family and lied to her stating that his dad Dr. Cullen got a job offer in Los Angeles, but, he made it quite clear that it was for him and his family\xe2\x80\x94he told her he didn\'t want to be with her\xe2\x80\xa6 leaving her in the woods heartbroken in a zombie state barely eating or sleeping sometimes when she does sleep she would have scream having nightmares over it that was about James or Victoria killing everyone\xe2\x80\xa6 it made uncle Charlie worried sick over Isabella \xe2\x80\xa6once she got a little better\xe2\x80\xa6she was hanging out with Jessica\xe2\x80\xa6 even her friends\xe2\x80\xa6 Jessica\xe2\x80\xa6 Angela\xe2\x80\xa6 Mike\xe2\x80\xa6 Tyler\xe2\x80\xa6 Eric... somewhat with Lauren were worried over their friend-until they made plans\xe2\x80\xa6 unfortunately it was only Jessica who came along \xe2\x80\xa6 since the ret of their friends were\xe2\x80\xa6 cancelled in the last minute after they watched the movie\xe2\x80\xa6 this is when Isabella started to see Edward as a hallucination \xe2\x80\xa6 running off to strangers in a motorcycle, jumping off cliffs, etc\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s not even half of what I heard from Ruby which I just got a text from her just now,""Are you bloody kidding me are you telling me when they broke up she\'s been heartbroken that she was like in her zombie state and going off to strangers," Hermione swore under her breath in French, German, Italian\xe2\x80\x94causing Ariel to wince knowing it made it worse for the cousins to hate Isabella even more "Is she bloody mad and rode off with a stranger no less in a motorcycle is she bloody stupid while toying and using Jacob\'s feelings ugh I can\'t stand that bloody girl?!" she exclaimed swearing once again as she threw a random vase in her old bedroom feeling her powers flowing through her as her eyes glowed anger with fire in her eyes."That\'s what exactly how I felt\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s \xe2\x80\xa6 stressing out uncle Charlie I manage to calm him down a bit\xe2\x80\xa6 after \xe2\x80\xa6 saving her scarwny arse\xe2\x80\xa6 but, there is it\xe2\x80\xa6""Unbelievable... I just\xe2\x80\xa6 don\'t understand her rash decision is driving me mad Ariel what the bloody hell was she thinking going off to strangers like that,""Apparently, she wasn\'t thinking at all," Ariel snorted "Are you calm enough to listen to the rest of the story since I just got a text from Ruby?""For now, so what exactly did Ruby say?""Sweet mother of Ravenclaw\xe2\x80\xa6 I just got another text apparently\xe2\x80\xa6 Ruby learned that Edward asked Isabella to marry him last summer and will turn her into a vampire himself because of the Volturi or else they\'ll kill her for knowing too much,""MARRIED THEY\'RE GETTING MARRIED?! YOU HAVE TO GOT TO BE KIDDING ME IS SHE BLOODY MAD!?" I exclaimed causing Ariel\'s to wince at this swearing like a sailor for a few minutes until I calm myself down "When\'s the wedding?""Right after they graduate high school within the summer in August from what Ruby told me anyway,"I couldn\'t help but, gape at her older sister "This year... the same year that we\'re coming to live with uncle Charlie and everyone back home,""Yes,"Hermione snorted and swore like a sailor "I can\'t believe she-I always knew she was selfish but, toying and using Jacob feelings over this is not right but, getting married to a bloody vampire is she mad, doesn\'t she even care about uncle Charlie or her mother with her husband Phil or is she that bloody selfish" she scowled "What else did you find out?""She\'s that bloody selfish Mia and there\'s a lot more but, it\'s going to take a week for us to talk about it, I\'ll text you the videos that happened in Italy with Blaise and Draco\'s help since they\'re connected with the Italian and the French Ministry then I am,""Good and be sure to send all the videos that you can find in Italy as well bloody hell that woman is-bloody selfish and she\'s already stressing me out as if I don\'t have enough to deal with and speaking of moving," Hermione sighed rubbing her shoulders from stress to rapidly changed the subject since I didn\'t want to talk about our estranged cousin anymore "I don\'t want to talk about this anymore\xe2\x80\xa6 can we talk about something else?""Me either \xe2\x80\xa6 and sure what do you want to talk about?""Anything really oh wait-I know what did you manage to pack everything from the apartment since the lease is almost up so it\'s perfect timing for us to move,""Yes, we\'re almost done but, George, Fred and I are packing the last of the store stocks, so it we should be done by Tuesday since we\'re going to be extending the store in America near uncle Charlie anyway he\'s always been a big fan of Fred and George latest inventions especially the pranks you remember what happen last time when we saw uncle Charlie?""Oh, Merlin I remember that," Hermione giggled at this remembering the first time they met "Harry was so nervous meeting uncle Charlie but, I can tell he loves him to bits though\xe2\x80\xa6uncle Charlie really loved Harry as if they were family "she smiled at the memory holding her locket "I miss him\xe2\x80\xa6very much" she whispered.Ariel soften her eyes "I know babes I miss him too. I bet he would\'ve want you to be happy including Ron and the others too,"Hermione sniffed giving a small smile "I know\xe2\x80\xa6 I just wish he didn\'t have to die early\xe2\x80\xa6 the quints are growing up so much\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s been nearly 3 years\xe2\x80\xa6" she whispered."I know\xe2\x80\xa6 but, this move will be good for us especially you\xe2\x80\xa6""I hope so\xe2\x80\xa6 I really hope so\xe2\x80\xa6"Ariel can tell her little sister Hermione missed her husband, so she decided to change the subject not wanting her to be sad then necessary "So tell me about this manor of yours that you found \xe2\x80\xa6 did you get a chance to look inside at the place yet?""Not yet but, I got the keys, port keys for emergency to each room to the place as soon as we arrive there it might be a bit dusty but, we\'ll fix it up it\'s not like Number 12 Grimmauld Place no dark artifacts or anything. I got Kreacher and the house elves to fix it up and presentable when we arrive,""Brilliant and if we find any dark artifacts then we\'ll get Draco, Blaise, Charlie, papa Remus and Jay to take care of it,""Or we can use the Gryffindor Sword\xe2\x80\xa6""The Gryffindor Sword I thought it\'s in Hogwarts,""It is but, Professor McGonagall gave me the copy of the Gryffindor Sword so it\'s not really the actually sword,""Oh," Ariel blinked her eyes in surprise "I wasn\'t aware they made \xe2\x80\xa6 a copy of-well that\'s-that-that\'s actually brilliant actually and we can always order some weapons from Yuki in Japan he\'s pretty good at it,"Hermione giggled knowing Yuki "Yes, I think that would be a good idea for training too once we fix up the manor and everything,""Brilliant as always see we\'re making plans already," Ariel grinned then heard one of her co-workers and got up thanks to Hermione\'s help "Oh shoot I have to get back to work and we\'ll talk later cookie and don\'t forget to write everyone,""Of course and I will owl Luna along with the others of the plan in a bit,""Sounds great see you later,""See you and please be careful when you apparate to the office huh? I don\'t want my future niece and nephews along with you to get hurt,""I will be extra careful not the first time I get pregnant you know,"Hermione chuckled "Don\'t I know it see you when you get home,""Later cookie bear,"Once Ariel and Hermione exchange goodbyes they headed back to work; Hermione packing their things while Ariel went to her lunch break to meet up with their brother Jay after finishing her work at St. Mungo\'s. Hermione bit her bottom lip looking at the time it was now 3:45 p.m. she got a quick parchment and quill to write to Luna asking her if she wanted to have a late lunch at her place and tied it on her owl Angel. It was a snowy owl that reminded her of Hedwig except her snow owl was a boy. It fitted him."Hello Angel," Hermione murmured petting her pet owl Angel "Do you think you\'d be able to give these letters to Luna and the others please,"Angel the owl hooted happily and flew off to Luna\'s house first knowing she\'ll know what to do. A few minutes later Angel comes back with a letter reply from Luna stating that she would love to have lunch; she should be arriving in a few minutes with the children, Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy, then Lorcan and Lysander Malfoy three boys and finally a baby girl\xe2\x80\x94they both decided to name her Pandora Selene Jaelynn Lovegood-Malfoy \'Penny\' for short. After a few minutes Hermione felt her wards off which stated that Luna and the others arrival as she got ready to prepare some lunch since they were almost done packing; all the needed to do is pack the last of the books in the Black library and they\'ll be good to go since everyone else is packed and ready to go."Hello? Anyone home?" Luna called out holding their Lorcan and Lysander the twins\xe2\x80\x94with their eldest son Scorpius with her husband Draco Malfoy not far behind being pregnant for 7 \xc2\xbd months along carrying their 4th child is thankfully it\'s a girl, Neville and Blaise with their twins Leo and Alice happened to accompany them visiting their favorite sister but, blood Hermione."In here Lulu," Tonks called out from the playroom. Luna, Draco, Blaise and Neville brought their children following the voice only to find Tonks being 6 \xc2\xbd months with quadruplets playing with the quints\xe2\x80\x94James Sirius II \'Jamie\', Seth Oliver Cameron, Harrison Jacob Daniel \'Henry\', Liliana Luna Rosalie \'Lily\' and Evelynn Sophia Carson Potter \'Evie\' playing with their cousin Teddy Lupin, Rose, Daisy, Amelia & Hugo Weasley-Potter. As they greeted each other with hugs and kisses."Hey Tonks," Blaise kissed Tonks on the cheek peeking through the playroom giving kisses and hugs to the kids by patting them on the heads "Where\'s Mia?" he asked looking around the room knowing his best friend who happens to be like a little sister usually with her children but, didn\'t find her anywhere."Where else would she be at this hour?" Tonks answered with her lips twitched.Luna, Blaise, Draco and Neville looked at each other than answered "Library," causing Tonks to laugh nodding at this."Wow the house is practically empty," Neville murmured scanning around."Yeah we been packing non stop since we got word that we\'re leaving this Friday instead of next week in Wednesday," Tonks explained."Sweet Salazar\xe2\x80\xa6 I guess Lulu was right then\xe2\x80\xa6" Draco murmured giving some money to Blaise who smirked putting the money inside his wallet "What color do you want B?""You already know my favorite color Drake," Blaise smirked "Don\'t forget it\'s blue and green," he explained."Boys what did you do," Luna scolded her husband Draco and Blaise her brother in-law who had panic looks "Don\'t tell me you made a bet over Mia again," she explained."Nothing luv it\'s just an innocent bet relax," Draco rubbing his hands over his wife Luna shoulders to calm her down not wanting to stress out due to being pregnant expecting their baby girl Pandora who will arrive within 2 \xc2\xbd months "I just didn\'t expect us to leave England forever that\'s all\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s really coming true," he explained.Luna soften her eyes over her husband "Draco \xe2\x80\xa6 are you sure you want to do this?" she murmured.Draco kissed her forehead "Yes, I\'m positive luv\xe2\x80\xa6 besides everything\'s already packed and I already got the house elves to help out with the manor as we speak so they should be cleaning the manor by the time we arrive in Friday," he explained.Luna nodded at this "Good because you have no choice but, to come with us," she smirked."You are a naughty minx you know that," Draco murmured causing Luna to giggle "I love you,""And I love you," Luna murmured."Okay, keep your pants on Drake considering there\'s kids in the room we don\'t want to give them nightmares huh," Neville chuckled causing Draco to roll his eyes with a nod as he didn\'t want to give his kids "So which rooms you need to pack Tonks?" he asked as he rapidly change the subject.~*~End of Chapter Six~*~Wow that\'s a long chapter I didn\'t realize it was already 12:29 am already *yawns* well this is where I\'ll stop for now since I updated three chapters so far and I will be updating more tomorrow since I know I owe you guys more updates on my chapters and don\'t worry I haven\'t forgotten my other stories I\'m just multitasking each one! Ciao for now dolls!\n(A/N: hey guys wow I didn\'t expect to have reviews that quick. Thank you so much so I thought I answered some of you guys. Guest #1: thank you so much for the review! I\'ll be sure to add new chapters when Hermione and her family arrives it\'s going to be \xe2\x80\xa6 a wild ride that not even the Cullens will even expect their arrival I\'ma make sure of it. Lol.Guest #2: Yes, Teddy Lupin is best friends with everyone in his family including the kids and has extended cousins so they\'ll have a very close relationship together and thank you for the review. I appreciate it a lot. Don\'t worry Hermione will be healing in her home town in time\xe2\x80\xa6 thanks to \xe2\x80\xa6 Jacob and Seth\'s support but, I\'m not going to spoil much.Guest #3: Thank you so much for the review\xe2\x80\xa6 and the reason Harry is stuck inside an egg is because he\'s still in his creature inheritance he hasn\'t hatched yet.Irmorena: Sorry about that I just rewrote everything so if you noticed that Hermione is 25 years old due to the time turner so therefore Harry would be 23 years old so in a way they\'re the same age despite the age difference their still married; however for Jacob and Seth they\'re still in high school seeing that Hermione is the same age as Sam who\'s 23 years old being the eldest, Alpha of the pack; it didn\'t show how old Sam was so I just made them they same age so technically no one knows that Hermione is older than she looks. I hope that helps and thanks so much for the review.Guest #4: Aww thanks so much for the review.

Ciao for now dolls.Chapter Seven: Harry\'s Last Wish"Mia and Remus packed all afternoon but, only needs to pack the Black library, Sirius and Regulus old bedrooms and that should be it since she got back from Kingsley\'s office, as far as I know the only ones that we\'re going to use \xe2\x80\xa6 for the surprise party-" Tonks began to say scanning around making sure Hermione wasn\'t in the room "Is the living room and the kitchen then we\'ll be leaving early in Friday," she explained."Brilliant us too," Neville nodded at this "We\'ll talk later yeah?""Of course and keep it old school Nev we don\'t want to spoil the surprise for Mia she deserves it after all and we\'ll talk about the plan later tonight and tell Jay to distract Mia in Thursday" Tonks laughed at this as she was playing with her baby boy Teddy who squealed happily along with the kids pretending to be a dragon "Grrr I\'m going to get you baby Teddy uh oh I\'m going to get you, I\'m going to get you," she cried out causing the kids to giggle and squeal running around the playroom causing the others to chuckle."Right-o," Neville saluted at Tonks scanning around the manor "Mione where are you?" he called out around the house."In here guys," Hermione called in a distance causing them to rush over to the library seeing that most of the books were all packed up inside her beaded bag "Downstairs in the Black library,""Got it" Draco answered causing them to rush over to the library helping his wife Luna inside seeing that the library now empty packed inside her beaded bag."Whoa\xe2\x80\xa6" Blaise, Neville and Draco murmured."Blood hell I see you\'ve been very busy," Draco spoke up helping his wife Luna sitting down kissing her on the forehead "Lu said that we\'re leaving Friday instead of next week in Wednesday like we planned what\'s that about?"Hermione sighed "Honestly Lulu are you ever going to let me tell them," she sighed causing Luna lips to twitch turning to Draco "The only reason I want to leave early it\'s because of the press they\'ve been extra reckless and been following me everywhere every day\xe2\x80\xa6 that it\'s sucking the energy out of me\xe2\x80\xa6 so I thought we can leave a week early than planned\xe2\x80\xa6 instead of next week so that way we can leave this Friday\xe2\x80\xa6 what do you guys think?" she explained."Sorry Mione, I had a vision that you would tell us about the whole thing which is why I planned ahead of time to pack everything inside our manor, Neville and Blaise did the same along with Ariel, George, Fred, Jay and Charlie who packed their things including the children\'s things around their place," Luna sighed as she sipped on her tea "And we already agreed that the press has been extra restless that it\'s starting to get hard to work in the Ministry office with the press following you around but, we\'re still coming with you no arguments" she explained answered for everyone causing Hermione to smile a little."I know Ariel told me that you had a vision that you packed everything no doubt telling them about it so I\'m glad for the help thanks Lulu," Hermione murmured."Anything for you and I\'m glad to help Mia," Luna sighed at this "So\xe2\x80\xa6 did you decide what you want to do when we go to Forks?" she explained."What do you mean?""I mean do we attend school portraying as students in high school or \xe2\x80\xa6 become a teacher in the school it helped a bit for the new school year and all,""What do you have in mind Lulu?""I thought\xe2\x80\xa6 since we\'re over 18 years old does Jay still in contact with his source back in Forks?""He does\xe2\x80\xa6 Taichi, Aqua, Ruby, and a few others, apparently Tai\'s the head principal at least he\'s portraying as the principle while Matty is the other principle in La Push High why?"Luna grinned "Why don\'t you take the job as principal in both schools?""Both schools\xe2\x80\xa6 as in LaPush High and Forks High why in Godric\'s name would I do that for?""Think about it\xe2\x80\xa6 you\'ll have your eyes and ears from your friends with brand new school rules that would change everything,""Like what?""Well .. you did say your cousin was making all sorts of trouble don\'t you want to teach her a lesson not as a classmate but, as her teacher?""Her teacher...now you want me to be the teacher and principal?""You could do both since it\'s your hometown after all?""I don\'t know\xe2\x80\xa6. I mean I do want to teach her a lesson\xe2\x80\xa6 she\'s not really thinking of the consequences\xe2\x80\xa6 of her damn actions\xe2\x80\xa6" Hermione sighed tiredly "What do you guys think?""I say do it\xe2\x80\xa6 from what you told us your cousin sounds horrid even I don\'t even like her,""Exactly you should do it Mione, teach her a lesson,""And if I take the principle and teacher job what are you guys going to do?""We can portray as the new teachers it can\'t be that hard right?""It\'s a muggle high school Draco,""I know but, think about it we can caught them off guard of the new schedules\xe2\x80\xa6 the classrooms, everything,""It sounds intriguing\xe2\x80\xa6 I don\'t know\xe2\x80\xa6""Do you want attend a muggle high school as a student Mia?""Not really but, we don\'t have a choice to pretend one don\'t we?""We can get any job anywhere in the world we want that include muggle jobs it\'s not like they\'ll find anything bad in our backgrounds except we\'re from England right?""Well.. you do have a point\xe2\x80\xa6 I did destroy the files of my family\xe2\x80\xa6 but, not before saving them into this flash drive that I have\xe2\x80\xa6""Flash drive?""Mhmm\xe2\x80\xa6it\'s all in here," Hermione began to say showing her werewolf flash drive causing her friends to gawk at her except Luna her lips twitched in amusement " It has everything\xe2\x80\xa6 the documents of our family backgrounds. It has a lot of room for everything that we need including my cousin\xe2\x80\xa6 making all sorts of trouble in Forks\xe2\x80\xa6""Really\xe2\x80\xa6in that small little thing?""Mhmm\xe2\x80\xa6it\'s like a hidden agenda as a werewolf pendant necklace which it\'s perfect since no one will ever suspect that it\'s also a flash drive, brilliant isn\'t it,""And you came up with that idea Mia?""Well yes, I did,""Why werewolf?""Well one of my animagus form is a werewolf,""One of your forms?""I have four,""FOUR?! How the bloody hell did you manage to do that,""Language Draco there\'s children in the other room,""Right sorry it\'s just.. How did you manage to get four forms?""I\'m a very powerful witch just like Harry was and it\'s not like I\'m the only one ya know,""What do you mean?""Lulu has four forms too,""WHAT?! And you failed to tell me this,""You never asked me,"Draco swore under his breath causing Luna lips to twitch "Oh don\'t be angry luv, you, Blaise, Neville and Theo will get the hang of things I promise,""I suppose your right," Draco sighed then gave a stern look "But, no more secrets luv,""Not making any promises but, I\'ll keep that in mind,""This is brilliant," Blaise began to say to look at the werewolf pendant "Do you think you can make us one too and has anyone ever told you that you\'re brilliant but, bloody scary Mia," he explained."Yes, yes I have,""Not scary you\'re bloody terrifying you know that,""Thank you,""Bloody hell so what did you find out about the reports?""It\'s bad news?...""Like what?""The Cullens\xe2\x80\xa6 being vampires\xe2\x80\xa6 Sam and his pack being shapeshifters as a werewolf pack\xe2\x80\xa6 the Quileute tribe werewolf pack \xe2\x80\xa6 not like the ones that we dealt with but, it\'s a family gene in the reservation through the legends that I heard growing up they\'re all true,""Shapeshifters?""Yes, as a wolf?""A werewolf?""Something like that yes, they\'re willing to transform whenever they want without to transform under the moon kind of thing,""Oh...what else did you find out?""The Volturi are involved against my cousin \xe2\x80\xa6 and her boyfriend\xe2\x80\xa6 ""Boyfriend?""Yes\xe2\x80\xa6 apparently his name is Edward Cullen," Hermione began to say who showed the files that Ariel gave her copies of it showing to Draco, Blaise, Neville and Luna the documents "That\'s him right there,""He looks so familiar..." Neville murmured."He does look familiar\xe2\x80\xa6 I just can\'t make it out\xe2\x80\xa6 who it was," Blaise asked squinting his eyes for a closer look towards the picture."Hey isn\'t he \xe2\x80\xa6 Cedric Diggory from Hufflepuff the one who got murdered from \'you know who\' in our 4th year," Draco blurted out."They really do alike and I thought that too at first but, that\'s not him...this is Edward Cullen you can say it\'s a doppelganger sort of thing,""Bloody hell..""That\'s what I said\xe2\x80\xa6" Hermione sighed tiredly rethinking what Luna suggestion where a grin showed upon her lips "You know what Lulu I think I\'ma do it. I\'ma teach that no good for nothing cousin that you messed with the wrong people that I care about...that includes hurting my uncle Charlie," she explained.Luna lips twitched "Do what exactly?""Be the head principle, the boss of the whole school\xe2\x80\xa6 but, I would need to mix it up a bit the schedules for each student, add new teachers which would you be guys just pick any subject you want to teach, change the classes from six to eight classes instead where we\'ll be starting at 7:00 in the morning instead of 8:00 and it would end at 5:00 p.m not 3:15 p.m. it would be brilliant\xe2\x80\xa6 and there\'s going to be a few changes around the school\xe2\x80\xa6" Hermione grinned causing Draco and the guys to feel a bit wary over this "And we only have four days to change everything with the right people\xe2\x80\xa6you\'ll be seeing your new boss in action?" she explained."So you\'re really doing it as their head principle on both schools, portraying as a student when you\'re really going to a teacher and the boss," Draco asked raising his eyebrow."Yes that\'s exactly what I\'m saying\xe2\x80\xa6" Hermione grinned grabbing a map of the school causing Draco and everyone to gawk at the girl except Luna who had her lips twitched in amusement "This is what I\'m going to do\xe2\x80\xa6 the first day is September 5th 2005 but, it\'s not going to be in September 5th instead it\'s going to be August 25, 2011 as planned," she explained,"And then what?" Neville asked.Hermione grinned "And then that\'s when the real fun starts\xe2\x80\xa6 from what my uncle Charlie told me my cousin is in vacation spending her summer with her mum in Florida... so she probably going to miss school thinking the first day is in September when it\'s really in August\xe2\x80\xa6and she\'s going to feel so confused over the changes around town thanks to me," she explained."Bloody hell has anyone ever told you that you\'re brilliant but, bloody terrifying," Neville murmured shivering over this."Yes, yes they have\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s Ron\'s favorite word whenever I have an idea against my enemies and Isabella is one of those people that I don\'t get along with despite how she\'s my dimwitted cousin," Hermione explained."This is why I don\'t tend to get in your bad side because your bloody terrifying Mya," Blaise shivered at this "No wonder we couldn\'t beat you in school we always thought you were cheating when you\'re really that smart\xe2\x80\xa6 and cunning\xe2\x80\xa6" he explained.Hermione grinned "Exactly," she explained.Draco shook his head "Sneaky and cunning," he smirked kissing his wife Luna on the forehead "How you managed to plan before we head to our destination?" he explained."I learn a thing or two from my loving husband?" Luna began to say then turned to Hermione "So what else are you planning against your cousin Mia?" she explained.Hermione sighed tiredly "Well if things work out as plan we\'re going to arrive in style, with a new reputation that not even my cousin will figure out how not even her boyfriend or his family," she explained."Well let the games begin and if you need any help let us know Mia?" Blaise smirked "I would love to help with that if you don\'t mind that is," he explained."Be all means go for it besides\xe2\x80\xa6 " Hermione began to say scanning the map of the school "We\'re also going to build a few buildings inside the school that\'s already in construction," she explained."Like what?""A new pool, new classrooms, a bigger parking lot since it\'s now holding 4,550 students instead of 450 students it\'s going to be \xe2\x80\xa6 a huge school to hold that many students,""And you knew about this they were under construction,""Of course my big brother Jay is the one that came up the idea I just decided to add myself into the mix which he\'d be damn proud,""I\'m sure he would or be awfully amuse,""You should see me back home when I got into mischief with my best friend Sam\xe2\x80\xa6 we used to do everything together\xe2\x80\xa6" Hermione began to say then frowned remembering what Ariel told her with a sigh "But, then again we\'re not the same people that we were once were\xe2\x80\xa6 I know I\'m not,""It\'s understandable Mia since we went through a war\xe2\x80\xa6 a few years ago,""We did\xe2\x80\xa6 and won the war against those death eaters but, in what cost\xe2\x80\xa6losing a lot of people including children in our school\xe2\x80\xa6 some who just started school\xe2\x80\xa6only to lose their lives over a manic monster""If you, Harry and Ron didn\'t find those horcruxes we\'d probably wouldn\'t be friends Mia or be in the same side of the war""Yeah\xe2\x80\xa6 I know\xe2\x80\xa6" Hermione began to drift off by stretching her arms "So\xe2\x80\xa6what else do you have in mind Lulu besides being the boss of two schools?" she explained.Luna gave a daze smile "Well building a swimming pool wouldn\'t be to bad, with a few new classrooms for extra credit to get a steady job when they graduate high school?" she explained."A swimming pool it\'s in the top of my list and what kind of steady jobs are we talking about here?" Hermione asked."Anything really whatever they got in their \xe2\x80\xa6 scores from what Ariel explained it\'s called C.A.T.S.E.E. or in some schools the SATs exams depending on what university schools they want to attend after they graduate with false information,""False information what do you mean by that?""Didn\'t you know\xe2\x80\xa6 apparently your cousin is attending a university in Alaska with her boyfriend ...didn\'t you know about that?""No...I didn\'t\xe2\x80\xa6 a university in Alaska?""That\'s what I been told?""From who?""Ariel didn\'t she tell you?"Hermione frowned "No\xe2\x80\xa6 she failed to mention that bit,""Oops\xe2\x80\xa6 well I\'m sure it\'s nothing really...right,""From what Ariel told me apparently she wants to be turned into a vampire\xe2\x80\xa6 into their clan\xe2\x80\xa6""The Cullens the one that you told us about,""Yes that would be the one?""That\'s a bit selfish don\'t you think? Doesn\'t she care about leaving her family behind\xe2\x80\xa6""No\xe2\x80\xa6 she doesn\'t care about anyone except herself and her boyfriend,"Draco raise his eyebrow "You don\'t sound like you like him Mia?"Hermione sighed tiredly "Honestly I don\'t and I never met the bloke,""What exactly did he do?""He made a mess of things in Italy?""Italy," Blaise rapidly got up alarmed "What did he do?""You should know you were there to get information from what Ariel told me?""You mean the ones that cause mayhem in Italy\xe2\x80\xa6 during the ceremony a few years ago?""Yes \xe2\x80\xa6"Blaise blank stared at Hermione then swore in Italian then in French then in Italian then other languages that Neville to blink his eyes owlish at his husband "B what\'s wrong?""You mean to tell me that no good for nothing-" Blaise stopped mid-sentence and swore under his breath in Italian "You have got to be kidding me\xe2\x80\xa6 that involves the Voturi that \xe2\x80\xa6 would be your cousin doing I assume,""Yes the very same one,""Bloody hell\xe2\x80\xa6no wonder you hate her\xe2\x80\xa6 and I don\'t blame you she\'s a threat to the whole magical community she\'s the reason why everyone is annoyed by her actions,""I know believe me I know that made my brother and sister to fix her mess without her knowledge or the Cullens and there\'s more apparently she\'s getting married\xe2\x80\xa6 next summer in August\xe2\x80\xa6 by then .. she\'ll be \xe2\x80\xa6 ""She\'s be what?""A vampire\xe2\x80\xa6 from what Ariel\'s source which is Aqua stated that he\'ll be the one to change her...and if he does that\xe2\x80\xa6 which it\'s against the treaty between two enemies,""Treaty what treaty?""If a Cullen were to bite a human or anyone else it would be treason meaning that they\'ll be in war and they can\'t afford that but, my dimwitted doesn\'t seem to understand that,""Bloody idiot,""That\'s what I said,""Bloody hell\xe2\x80\xa6. no wonder you guys don\'t get along with her,""There\'s a lot of reasons really but, this pulls the cake\xe2\x80\xa6" Hermione began to say with a tired sigh "But, speaking of jobs\xe2\x80\xa6what job are you going to do when we reached to America?" she explained."Well I\'ll be the teacher for potions?""You mean chemistry,""Same thing,""Right\xe2\x80\xa6 anything else?""Neville and I will be in charge for Biology and Fashion,""And Blaise what will you be doing?"Blaise grinned "Oh this is my favorite bit I\'ll be in charge of the class of Police Academy and R.O.T.C. for both police and army," he explained."Nice," Hermione giggled at this "Sounds perfect for you guys?""And what will you be doing Mia?""English, Math, History, P.E. Music, Dancing, Journalism, and being the boss in both schools,""That\'s a lot,""You know me I like to mix it up a bit,""Is it possible to be in charge of the clubs they have Mione?""Yes, you can pick any clubs for this year for the all four-freshman and sophomore will have to learn the basics but, once you reach 11th grade\xe2\x80\xa6 you\'ll be able to pick a job course for extra credit when you go to college or university and then for 12th grade seniors they\'ll have to work extra hard to graduate I won\'t be going easy on them,""Sounds\xe2\x80\xa6 terrifying even for you,""I know sounds brilliant don\'t you think?""Well I would hate to be in their shoes especially having you as a teacher,""Oh ha, ha, ha very funny,""You know you love it Mia and besides we already talking to Minerva about the job offer that she gave each of us and she thought it was a good idea that we leave together and I figured that I tell you the good news about the whole thing; It\'s why we came to visit you a bit early," Luna began to say then gave a tired yawn sipping her tea "We got everything packed and set for us to plan everything out, Draco and I talked about it as a family since we both agreed to accompany you to America as we planned," she explained."How did you know I was going to ask?""I know you to well since you tend to worry a bit,""I do not,""Mione no offense you\'re like a mama bear towards all of us despite how you\'re only 2 years older than us and everything if it wasn\'t for the time turner,"Hermione sighed "Harry and Ron told you huh?""Something like that, no wonder I kept seeing double back in 3rd year,""Are you guys sure you want to leave with me in Friday instead of next week if not I\'ll totally understand,"Draco sighed at this "Honestly Mya how many times must we repeat ourselves we\'re going with you end of discussion stop being stubborn and a Gryffindor okay we\'re not leaving your side got it," he began to say scolding her playfully causing Hermione teared up which left him to soften his eyes "Besides\xe2\x80\xa6 we promised Harry we protect you at all cost I\'m not breaking my promise over with him," he explained."What\xe2\x80\xa6" Hermione whispered turning to Draco with a pale look "Harry\xe2\x80\xa6when did you talk to Harry?"Draco paled "Uhh\xe2\x80\x94" he was about to answer but, Blaise cut him off not wanting to give anything away."He meant it was before he died\xe2\x80\xa6" Blaise announced causing everyone to look at him oddly "He went to talk to us\xe2\x80\xa6 along with Lu\xe2\x80\xa6 and Nev\xe2\x80\xa6 before he died\xe2\x80\xa6 didn\'t he luv"Neville stared at his husband Blaise with an odd look trying to remember what he promise Harry "Ye-yeah he did\xe2\x80\xa6 but, I didn\'t know you knew that,"Blaise shrugged "I hear things and Harry told me about it,""Oh...that would explain the \xe2\x80\xa6 secret looks that he gave Mione," Neville murmured."What secrets looks?" Hermione asked.Neville sighed "I had a feeling he\'s been planning this for a long time Mione it would explain a lot," he murmured."He did\xe2\x80\xa6why would he do that?" Hermione frowned at this "And not tell me about this?" she asked who looked a little hurt.Blaise sighed "Oh Mya you know Harry better than all of us\xe2\x80\xa6 he just wants you and the kids to be safe and taken care of\xe2\x80\xa6 and Nev\'s right he has been planning this in case something were to happen to him or Ron\xe2\x80\xa6 they both did\xe2\x80\xa6 and he knew you would have protested over the whole thing which is why he kept it as a secret while you were being busy in St. Mungo\'s with Ginny, Lulu, Susan and Hannah from the past four years before you guys decided to quit\xe2\x80\xa6 " he whispered.Hermione furrowed her eyebrows staring at the window "I see\xe2\x80\xa6 he\'s been asking all of our friends \xe2\x80\xa6 a lot of people to look after me and the kids hasn\'t he\xe2\x80\xa6 even Ron\xe2\x80\xa6" she whispered."Yeah I think they did\xe2\x80\xa6.wouldn\'t you feel the same way if things were reverse?" Draco asked."Probably\xe2\x80\xa6" Hermione murmured"Harry told me that he felt that you should be watch over you and take care of you with the kids if something were to happen to him and Ron\xe2\x80\xa6 or anyone else in that matter in case we didn\'t win the war...it was his last wish with us Mione\xe2\x80\xa6" Neville murmured.Hermione sighed "I suppose I can understand that since I would\'ve felt the same way if things were reverse but, what about your company Draco?" she explained."I\'ll still be in charge in my company it\'s not like it\'s going anywhere besides\xe2\x80\xa6 I learned which properties you were going to use\xe2\x80\xa6" Draco drifted off with a raise eyebrow causing Hermione to blush at this "Does\xe2\x80\xa6the \'Black Pearl\' mean anything to you Mya apparently it\'s where uncle Sirius stayed when he was on the run in a small town called Forks it\'s in this small reservation muggle town no less know anything about that?" he explained."Why am I not surprised that you would\'ve found out either I told you or not and knew you were going to say that\xe2\x80\xa6" Hermione chuckled shaking her head "It\'s not like I asked for this Draco the money I mean but, Sirius, Harry, Ron and the rest of the Weasley\'s including Dean and Seamus were very pacific since I honestly don\'t need the money but, they insisted it\'s already done and to stop being so stubborn about the whole thing," she scowled causing everyone to chuckle since they were there hearing the will from Harry, Ron, Sirius and the rest of the Weasley\'s who got killed during the raid attack thanks to the death eaters as they went to Gringotts Blank for their Will and Testament "Honestly \xe2\x80\xa6I\'m a bit surprised that there\'s a manor in my home town of all places to be honest I didn\'t know about it until I went to the bank the other day but, I did remember that Sirius told me that he was staying in Hawaii once maybe he didn\'t stay long at the manor in Forks back then\xe2\x80\xa6since Bex lives in Hawaii so I had a feeling Sirius was staying with her and her family or with uncle Holden my other godfather" he explained."Forks, Washington right. Your hometown the one that you been talking about non stop that home town?" Blaise asked."Yes that would be the one,""Where you were born and raise for a bit,""Yes...is that a problem""No I don\'t have a problem\xe2\x80\xa6 I\'m just curious why you kept that information from us \xe2\x80\xa6 because\xe2\x80\xa6.?"Hermione shrugged "You never asked me\xe2\x80\xa6 since we weren\'t friends back in school and it never came up in conversation outside my school life," she began to say then turned to Draco "Oh and speaking of godfathers Draco\xe2\x80\xa6 apparently my godfather uncle Billy is related to you Draco so \xe2\x80\xa6 technically you have cousins in Forks too," she explained."What\xe2\x80\xa6" Draco gawked at this "I do\xe2\x80\xa6 I didn\'t realize I\'d-who is it?""Billy Black he\'s my godfather he\'s also best friends with my uncle Charlie since I can remember\xe2\x80\xa6 and he has three children\xe2\x80\xa6 Rebecca\xe2\x80\xa6 which I called her Bex\xe2\x80\xa6 then there\'s Rachel they\'re both twins mind you being the eldest and there\'s little Jacob, you guys met them before at the wedding remember?""You mean the gruffy guy with the American accent that\'s your uncle Charlie?" Neville pondered at this causing Hermione to nod at this "And he brought his friends with him along with their kids?""Yes, that would be them. Leah and Seth are my uncle Harry and my auntie\'s Sue\'s kids being my godparents and then Jacob Black will be Draco\'s long-lost cousin so technically we\'re 2nd cousins through marriage," Hermione grinned causing Draco to gawk at this "And \xe2\x80\xa6 Jacob\'s sisters Rebecca and Rachel. Rebecca\'s married to a surfer and live in Hawaii. That\'s where Harry and I went to our honeymoon in Hawaii," she explained."Really?""Yeah, I was a bit surprised until I saw the family tree of Sirius,""Huh\xe2\x80\xa6. well what do you know\xe2\x80\xa6 I have relatives \xe2\x80\xa6 in Forks\xe2\x80\xa6" Draco murmured while Luna lips twitch "Cool\xe2\x80\xa6bloody brilliant I can\'t wait to meet them. I always wanted to see what your home town looks like,"Blaise gawked at her opening his mouth imitating like a fish; apparently Hermione left him speechless over that "Well what do you know we learned something new every day huh Mia," he murmured causing everyone to chuckle at this in agreement "So.\xe2\x80\xa6if Drake, Theo, Pansy and I were friends with you around in our schools years do you think maybe then we would\'ve got to know the real you back then \xe2\x80\xa6 it would\'ve been quite different don\'t you think," he explained.Hermione giggled "Probably and don\'t be mad Blaise it\'s not that big of a deal\xe2\x80\xa6 I mean my family and I moved to England when I was about eight years old\xe2\x80\xa6 so you didn\'t really miss much except they upgraded the latest technology and all that," she explained."Then how did you guys end up in England then?""Well as I explained my family and I moved when I was about eight years old\xe2\x80\xa6 Ariel was ten years old and Jay was 13 so he was already attending Hogwarts by then \xe2\x80\xa6" Hermione drifted off with a distant look on her face which left her friends to look at each other worriedly "Anyway my parents extended their dentistry practice in England at first Jay was attending Salem Academy of Magic for the first four years but, he decided to transfer to Hogwarts to live near us and by then he graduated with honors then moved away to New York; by then Ariel was maybe in her 6th year in Hogwarts by then they both decided to change their names into \'Swan\' and not use Granger not wanting to get us in danger then we already are while I used our original name \'Granger\' to keep up appearances," she explained with a shrug."Oh," Draco, Blaise, and Neville answered."But, I do have a question though?" Hermione asked."And what\'s that Mya?" Luna asked."If you guys were planning to come with me then who\'s going to be the teachers in Hogwarts?" Hermione asked."Minerva hired new teachers that you know,""Who?""Autumn Collins but, most people call her Ruby, she\'ll be the Head of Slytherin,""Really\xe2\x80\xa6""Mhmm,""What about the other head the houses?""Jennifer Chang who\'s Cho\'s little sister would be the Head of the House of Ravenclaw, then Jared Palmer will be the Head of Hufflepuff House and Athena Yu Wu will be the Head of House of Gryffindor anything else?""No that was it I just didn\'t realize \xe2\x80\xa6 you\'d be all coming with me since you have your own lives and all I would hate to be the burden of that,""Trust me you\'re not a burden to either of us Mione besides Blaise and I talked about it extending our family into a new place to start fresh since we also want to heal from the memories of the war,""That does make sense\xe2\x80\xa6" Hermione began to say biting her bottom lip nervously "Are you guys sure you don\'t want too\xe2\x80\x94" she was cut of by Luna."We\'re coming with you deal with it," Luna snapped at this causing everyone to chuckle."Okay, okay I was just asking relax," Hermione assured her sister Luna which left her to huff while everyone chuckled, Draco however kissed his wife Luna on the forehead knowing how stubborn Hermione is "Honestly I don\'t mind you coming along it\'s just\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s going to be really different the town is all muggle, we can\'t do magic in public unless we\'re at home or in the magical school that the kids will attend when they get older...it\'s just\xe2\x80\xa6 you have your whole lives in England and I don\'t want to ruin that\xe2\x80\xa6 and even if you did come to visit I can introduce you to my childhood friends\xe2\x80\xa6before my family and I moved back to England\xe2\x80\xa6" she drifted off with a distant memory "Actually I just came up with the most brilliant genius plan on what we could do with the land if you guys are for up for it since the land is pretty huge it\'s 550,000,000 acres wide and long we can add some buildings and other ideas are accepted," she explained."And we understand that but, with the paparazzi asking us questions about the war as well \xe2\x80\xa6wanted details about everything is a bit tiring \xe2\x80\xa6 besides we already packed our things," Draco began to say causing Hermione to sigh tiredly knowing how stubborn her friends are noticing the guys raising her eyebrow at this notion "And we know the town is all muggle but, with new plans in the town I\'m sure we\'ll get along just fine since I didn\'t realize the population of the property was huge until you confirmed it; I even thought of our first project," he explained."And what would that be I wonder... ?""A Quidditch field how about it?"Hermione laughed at this; it was the first time she laughed since Harry\'s death which made Luna smile at this; she missed hearing her best friend\'s laugh it always brightens up the room "Of course it\'s the top of my list," she explained."Brilliant we can combine our idea\'s once we get there," Draco grinned "We can even teach the kids a thing or two about Quidditch too and we can also make a village where we can shop both magical and non magical what do you think?," he explained."Really," Hermione perked up feeling a bit happy "That\'s even more brilliant I\'ll even connect the floo once we arrive to Forks in Friday, so you guys will be able to head to wherever you\'re heading too," she explained."Perfect what time are we leaving in Friday?" Blaise asked."Friday 3:30 in the morning so we have to leave quite early," Hermione explained."How early?" Neville asked."Yes, very early 12:00 a.m. in the latest you know how the press tends to twist things," Hermione murmured causing everyone to nod knowing the \'Daily Prophet\' tends to twist a lot of things these days then realized something "Wait a minute did you just say Ruby Collins is going to be co-head in Slytherin House along with Athena being co-head in Gryffindor?" she explained."Yeah why?" Blaise asked.Hermione gawked at Luna who gave a dreamy smile then shook her head "No reason it\'s just\xe2\x80\xa6I thought they both were working in America only to find out that their back in town in England only now I\'m moving away from England while they stays here\xe2\x80\xa6 they\'re one of my childhood friends growing up I didn\'t realize their back home," sh explained."Does that mean you know them then?" Draco asked."Are you kidding they\'re like Ariel\'s partner in crime besides Aqua her twin sister, Leah, Rae and Bex; they formed a group together as kids I forgot what\'s it called\xe2\x80\xa6wait I think it\'s starting to come back \'Cheetah Girls\' that\'s what they used to call themselves\xe2\x80\xa6" Hermione shook her head "Oh my Merlin those were the days we used to do so much mischief back in the day\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s been a long time since I talked to Rubs and Aqua I miss them so much\xe2\x80\xa6since she\'s the quints godmother I would hate for them to lose in touch with each other" she drifted off with a sad smile "I\'ll be sure to owl her when I get a chance we have a lot to catch up with one another," she explained."I\'m sure she\'ll love that," Blaise assured her "And you being mischief no way,""It\'s true you can ask Ariel and Jay about it," Hermione giggled remembering the memory "I remember how Ariel, Jay and I would drove my cousin crazy \xe2\x80\xa6 whenever we play hide and seek we end up ditching her because she always complained about our home town\xe2\x80\xa6 despite how she was born there\xe2\x80\xa6 " she snorted at this "Just wait till you meet her guys and you\'ll know what I mean but, I bet you anything she hasn\'t changed one bit\xe2\x80\xa6 and yet I have\xe2\x80\xa6 I don\'t know if I told you guys this\xe2\x80\xa6 but, I haven\'t went home\xe2\x80\xa6 since I was 13 years old\xe2\x80\xa6 that was probably the last time I ever saw my uncle Charlie despite how we kept in touch over the years\xe2\x80\xa6 I\'m just glad I get to go home \xe2\x80\xa6 " she explained."I can tell you hate your cousin Isabella," Neville pointed out.Hermione snorted "Hate is an understatement Nev\xe2\x80\xa6 she was \xe2\x80\xa6 way worse then Draco was when he was bullying us in school," she explained.Draco raise his eyebrow at Hermione "How bad\xe2\x80\xa6 are we talking about?" he asked."Let\'s just say\xe2\x80\xa6 she toyed with your little cousin Draco who happens to be Jacob\xe2\x80\xa6 Jacob Black\xe2\x80\xa6" Hermione pointed out.Draco eyes turned harden over this as he wanted to meet his cousin unknown to him "Did she now\xe2\x80\xa6""Yeah\xe2\x80\xa6 do you remember that kid that was pretty shy at the wedding he was a bit tall for his age\xe2\x80\xa6 and always with that gruffy guy all the time," Hermione pointed out "He was one of the groomsmen at my wedding with Harry," she explained.Draco paused for a moment as it dawn to him "You mean Seth?""No that\'s not Jacob he\'s the tall one\xe2\x80\xa6 he was pretty handsome last time I saw him and he had a ponytail apparently it\'s the latest trends back in America," Hermione smirked at this "And he also said it helped with the \'ladies\' that had a crush on him," she giggled at this "And with Seth he was always the curious one I\'m pretty sure he inherited that from uncle Harry my other godfather," she explained."You sound like you like them both Mia?" Draco asked."I always have a soft spot towards Jacob and Seth too\xe2\x80\xa6 only because\xe2\x80\xa6 auntie Sara\xe2\x80\xa6 Jacob\'s mum\xe2\x80\xa6 she passed away when he was a kid\xe2\x80\xa6 so I always been a mama bear towards him," Hermione murmured.Draco soften his eyes at this remembering the reception party "Oh yeah I think I remember now\xe2\x80\xa6 and your uncle godfather Billy\xe2\x80\xa6 he was in a wheelchair didn\'t he?" he asked."He does\xe2\x80\xa6 he got in a car crash\xe2\x80\xa6 I\'m hoping to help uncle Billy to walk again\xe2\x80\xa6 if I can\xe2\x80\xa6" Hermione murmured."I bet he would really love and appreciate that Mia and Draco it\'s true about Mia being mischief I have seen the pictures to prove it too even I was a bit surprised by this," Luna giggled causing Draco to look amuse "Especially when her uncle Charlie told me stories about her childhood stated it was all Mia\'s idea about the whole prank thing against her cousin Isabella," she explained."Really you Mya\xe2\x80\xa6 no way?" Draco grinned at this "Now this I have got to see\xe2\x80\xa6 no wonder Harry looked terrified when your uncle Charlie warned him about the pranks," he explained chuckling at this."It\'s true I may have a little mischief inside my blood," Hermione winked playfully says "And I don\'t remember hearing that,""Little I would say a lot Mia your cousin looked like she wanted to kill you because of that," Luna giggled causing Hermione to snort at this "And she doesn\'t sound nice from what Ariel and Jay told me and I believe you were talking to your cousin Vinny," she explained."She\'s not really nice to begin with and it maybe a while but, I still got a few plans up for my sleeve," Hermione smirked at this "And as for my cousin Vinny he never liked Isabella either apparently she tried to flirt with him which he felt like he was going to vomit when he heard that, good thing he\'s married," she explained giggling at this."Now this I have got to see there\'s no way you would be since you always been a goody-good girl," Neville pointed out "Especially in school,""I was but, when you mess with me let\'s just say I have a lot more pranks inside my sleeve that I can be very sneaky between the shadows than you think," Hermione winked playfully causing the others to chuckle "So yeah you guys are going to leave with the rest of the lot then?" she explained looking around her friends who nodded at this."Yes, for the millionth time yes," Luna, Draco, Neville and Blaise answered.Hermione giggled "Okay, okay just wanted to double check since we only have four days since we\'re leaving quite early and be very discreet. We\'ll keep a low profile before we head to America without anyone finding out we\'re leaving," she explained."Trust me no one knows that we\'ll be leaving it\'s just going to be us and we already packed our things," Draco assured her "Who else is going to come besides us lot?" he explained."Good that\'s good and my children\xe2\x80\x94the quints James, Seth, Lily, Evie, Henry, then Rose, Daisy, Amelia and Hugo" Hermione listed her children first as they nodded at this "Then Tonks, Remus, Teddy and Mrs. Tonks\xe2\x80\x94then Ariel and George with their family, Fred with his kids then Charlie Weasley then there\'s you guys Draco, Luna, with the boys and baby Penny, and then Blaise and Neville with Alice and Leo along with the newborn triplets, that\'s almost 20 people I think but, other than that the less people the better," she explained.Draco nodded "Good, just like we planned we\'ll meet you guys at the airport although Blaise and I will be joining two weeks afterwards due to a \xe2\x80\xa6 business trip" he explained."Perfect and that\'s completely fine," Hermione sighed tiredly "Well let\'s have some lunch, shall we?" she offered causing everyone to nod at this while their children were playing with one another at the playroom.That was until Theodore Nott and his wife Pansy Nott \'nee Parkinson with their children Olivia Cameron Nott \'Liv\' (OC), Maddison Dove Nott \'Maddie\' (OC) who are twins (6 years old), Veronica Camilla Nott \'Ronnie or Vee\' (OC) (3 years old)\xe2\x80\x94Gregory Tyler Nott \'Greg\' II (OC), Vincent Blaise Nott \'Vince\' (OC), and Marcus Tristen Nott \'Marc\' (OC)\xe2\x80\x94Pansy is expecting triplets all boys much to Theo\'s happiness since he always wanted a son being 6 \xc2\xbd months pregnant, three more months until their sons arrive."Hello? Anyone in here?" Pansy asked."In the kitchen," Hermione called from the background where Theo and Pansy revealed themselves and greeted them with their children "Hey guys, what are you doing here?""Aunt Minnie," Liv, Maddie & Veronica exclaimed running to their aunt and godmother who smiled at the children.Hermione soften her eyes holding the children "Oh my favorite babies you\'re getting so big my lovelies,""We miss you aunt Minnie," Veronica whimpered."Oh, and I have miss you too my baby V have you been good to your mummy and daddy?""Yesh," Veronica murmured nuzzled at her godmother causing the adults to laugh as they sat down to have some lunch."Sorry we\'re a little late but, we heard from a little birdie that you were leaving within 4 days in Friday instead of next week in Wednesday," Theo murmured giving her a playfully glare.Hermione sighed "I was going to tell you in person\xe2\x80\x94 "giving a look to Luna who smiled innocently at this "But, apparently someone beat me to it," she explained."So, you really going to leave this Friday instead of next week in Wednesday Mya?" Pansy murmured; Pansy and Hermione grew close friends after the war after she apologized to Harry, Ron, and Hermione apparently, she had a huge change of heart towards the \'Golden Trio\' Gryffindor\'s."Yes, the press is getting more intense than usual especially when I have the children James, Seth, Lily, Evie, and Henry along with Rose, Daisy, Amelia and Hugo to think about\xe2\x80\x94 "Hermione murmured looking at her children eating their late lunch as they became quite messy eaters "I need a break from everything. I hope you guys can understand that," she whispered."We get it Mya no need to explain it to us," Theo assured her "We would\'ve felt the same way if we were moving across the country to America no less," he explained."He\'s right." Pansy sighed tiredly sipping her water "It would be awfully lonely without you guys especially since Lulu is coming with you aren\'t you Lu,""Yes I am and it would be quite lonely without you too Pansy," Luna nodded at this "And you guys are always welcome to come live with us in Forks the property is pretty huge and Pansy don\'t you have something to tell us \xe2\x80\xa6 any good news that you want to share\xe2\x80\xa6" she smirked as her lips twitched "And the property that Mia has is a huge property so there\'s a chance we can build a few houses along the way it would be perfect for us to be neighbors don\'t\' you think?" she explained."And don\'t you have to tell us something Lu?" Theo began to say raising his eyebrow at this "And I like that idea are you guys really?" he explained."We are planning to build a Quidditch field so why the hell not and tell us your news first and then we\'ll tell you ours," Draco answered."No, we can wait you guys go first we insist," Theo pointed out.Draco, Luna, Blaise and Neville looked at each other leaving Luna to speak up between them "Draco, Neville, Blaise and I decided to accompany Mya, Charlie, Fred, George, Ariel, Tonks, Remus, Teddy with our children to America," she explained."All of you are going to America," Pansy gawked at this causing everyone to nod at this "I remember you telling me that you were moving but, I didn\'t expect it to be in America no less\xe2\x80\xa6" she murmured."You remember when I told you guys that I wanted to move away from England\xe2\x80\xa6" Hermione murmured."Yes, we remember?" Theo murmured."Well \xe2\x80\xa6my children and I are moving there in Washington if we\'re going to be more pacific\xe2\x80\xa6" Hermione sighed tiredly "I found one of \'Black\' properties called the \'Black Pearl\' it was Sirius old hide out when he was on the run before we had enough evidence that he\'s innocent child and gave him a fair trial that he should\'ve got years ago\xe2\x80\x94" she drifted off feeling that sadness in her heart "Anyway it\'s in La Push it\'s in a small reservation that\'s near my godparents my uncle Billy, my uncle Harry and his wife auntie Sue and the rest of the elders who live there. My uncle Charlie lives in Forks, Washington it\'s my home town actually so I\'ll be living there away from the press who kept hounding me for an interview and you know how I feel about that," she explained."What time are you leaving in Friday Mya?" Pansy asked."I rescheduled our flights from Wednesday morning next week to this week in Friday 3:30 in the morning so we\'ll be leaving quite early around 12:00 in the morning," Hermione paused for a moment "I\'m all done with packing the only thing that we\'re going to be using is the living room and the kitchen for the last hurrah that I\'m having in Wednesday and I should be good to go for Friday," she explained."And I assume you\'re going to visit Harry at the cemetery in Wednesday and then transferring their burials in Forks, Washington," Theo asked.Hermione held her breath nodded at this "Yes, it would be a little weird not visiting him every day like I always do in the morning but, I think he would\'ve understood\xe2\x80\xa6and I\'m planning on changing his burial to Forks along with the rest of the Weasley\'s in Thursday since Aqua and Ruby called a few people to help out," she explained.~*~End of Chapter Seven~*~Whooooooo! I\'m done with this chapter it took a while to come up with the next few chapters but, I managed to finish new chapter and see how it works out in the end. I\'ll probably stop in Ch. 12 and continue more in the weekend but, not sure about the plans since it\'s Father\'s Day Weekend! Let me know what you guys think?\nChapter Eight: Making Secret Plans For Forks!"Really how long will it take to transfer their burials from England to Forks, Washington?" Draco asked."A few hours but, they should be settled in before we arrive to Forks, Washington I made sure to give the best powerful wards and spells known to man that no one will ever to disturb them," Hermione began to say with a tired sigh "And it\'s already done I got Aqua and Ruby to help out since they know people to help out so that way the kids and I can visit them whenever we want all I need to do is sign the forms and it will be good to go\xe2\x80\xa6 I just don\'t think I can handle living here in England after everything that happen\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s to hard\xe2\x80\xa6 it reminds me of the memories I had with my friends\xe2\x80\xa6 and it\'s why I wanted to leave early than planned in Friday instead of next week in Wednesday \xe2\x80\xa6 does..does that make selfish," she whispered."Of course not," Luna began to say holding Hermione into a hug "Harry would\'ve understand why \xe2\x80\xa6 if things were reverse \xe2\x80\xa6he wouldn\'t want you to be happy along with the children along with Ron, Bill, Percy, Ginny, Mr. and Mrs. Weasley with the rest of the lot and I\'m sure everyone will just fine wherever they\'re buried just like my daddy would," she whispered.Hermione blinked her tears "I miss him so much Lulu\xe2\x80\xa6 why did he have to die and leave me alone\xe2\x80\xa6along with everyone else it\'s too hard" she leaned her head against Luna\'s shoulder while she held her close giving worried looks to her husband Draco and the others who looked sad over this "I miss him so much," she whispered."We miss them too just as much as you do\xe2\x80\xa6" Luna held her best friend who\'s like a sister into a comfort hug "But, you know what Harry\'s always right here," as she pointed her heart "He\'ll always going be with you in spirit and in your heart along with the children just like Ron, Ginny, and the rest of the family who lost their lives that day\xe2\x80\xa6 they would\'ve understood why you wanted to leave England," she explained.Hermione gave a teary laugh nodding at this "Yeah\xe2\x80\xa6 I know\xe2\x80\xa6 look at me crying my eyes out\xe2\x80\xa6 I guess leaving this place is making quite emotional\xe2\x80\xa6 than usual,""Hey, no worries you can cry all you want it\'s better to let it out then let it in don\'t you think, and we\'ll be your shoulders to cry on\xe2\x80\xa6 when you need to talk Mione," Neville assured her."Thanks, Nev\xe2\x80\xa6" Hermione murmured."Of course, what are brothers are for," Neville replied smiling at his sister."I can\'t believe you guys are leaving\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s going to be so weird without visiting you lot\xe2\x80\xa6 Mya" Pansy whispered sadly."Yes\xe2\x80\xa6" Hermione bowed her head sadly "You know how the press tends to twist things over my relationship with Harry, our friends\xe2\x80\xa6 and my family\xe2\x80\xa6 I don\'t want the children to hear horrid things about their father when it\'s not even true\xe2\x80\xa6at least some of it anyway\xe2\x80\xa6 I want them to know that their father loves them very much and would do anything in his power to protect them no matter what just like I would\xe2\x80\xa6 I just\xe2\x80\xa6 I can\'t stay here anymore\xe2\x80\xa6 when it brings me so much pain and\xe2\x80\xa6" she drifted off sadly with a distant look. "And horrid memories\xe2\x80\xa6 but, not all them because-""Because of Harry and Ron\xe2\x80\xa6 "Theo whispered.Hermione nodded wiping her tears "Yes\xe2\x80\xa6 despite how I still have you guys you\'re the only people that I talk too\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s better that I move away across the country make a fresh start for myself and the children\xe2\x80\xa6are you angry with me?" she whispered."No, we\'re not angry with you Mya we completely understand why\xe2\x80\xa6 I would\'ve felt the same way if I ever lost Theo, Draco or Blaise\xe2\x80\xa6 "Pansy whimpered looking at her children with Theo who nodded at this "In fact\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s one the reasons why we\'re here Mya\xe2\x80\xa6 we were just wondering if you have any room \xe2\x80\xa6 as soon as it\'s near the baby shower\xe2\x80\xa6 Theo and I will be moving across America once we take care of things\xe2\x80\xa6 would that be alright with you," she whispered.Hermione looked up in surprised "Move to America\xe2\x80\xa6 you do know it\'s a muggle town right\xe2\x80\xa6?""Oh, who cares if it\'s a muggle town or not you know I don\'t believe in that stuff anymore and neither does Theo\xe2\x80\xa6 we both talked about it\xe2\x80\xa6" Pansy cried out."Are you guys sure\xe2\x80\xa6" Hermione hesitated at this "I mean what about England this is your home\xe2\x80\xa6""Mione listen to me," Luna looked at her in the eyes with a serious look "WE ARE GOING got it?!""Yes m\'ame," Hermione murmured causing everyone to laugh at this "I was just checking ...""We know!" Luna and the boys exclaimed."Relax Mya you need to stop worrying over everything. It\'s our turn to take care of you and the kids okay," Draco assured her.Hermione sighed trying to relax "I\'ll try but, okay," she murmured."Good," Draco told her."But, what about\xe2\x80\x94" Hermione was cut off by Pansy who snapped at this being pregnant it tends to happen due to hormones."Mya\xe2\x80\xa6 who cares if it\'s a muggle or wizard town or whatever\xe2\x80\xa6 ever since you introduced me to the latest muggle fashion over there I absolutely love it besides the wizarding community hasn\'t even upgraded new clothes that are dresses like old fashion while the ones in muggle London have dresses that are short which is one of the reasons why I love the muggle fashion over there," Pansy huffed causing everyone to laugh "Besides if it wasn\'t for you and your sister Ariel I wouldn\'t be learning all about the muggle fashion in America," she explained."She\'s right Mione," Luna giggled "Do you remember how Pansy and Ginny were so stunned by the latest fashion over in America that it took the both of us to snap them out of it. It was like they never seen the store called Forever 21 before," she explained.Hermione lips twitched "Oh yes, I remember it was quite the field day when we both brought you guys to Forever 21 it was when our friendship with Pansy started along with Ginny of course and they loved the bathing suits, the tang tops, shorts, jeans, etc then we took them to Victoria Secret that was my favorite store with everything that you can imagine" she sighed "We pretty much nearly bought the whole store that it stunned the co-workers working there, that was a fun day," she explained."Exactly so what do you guys think you have room for another set of family to come along," Pansy asked.Hermione and Luna turned to each other with smiles "Are you kidding it wouldn\'t be the same without you guys if you didn\'t come with us so that\'s a bloody hell yes Pansy," Hermione explained."Oh, thank bloody Salazar," Pansy leaning her head over the girls who giggled patting their friend over the head "I\'m so glad you guys agree because I would\'ve been so bored without you girls," she whined at this."Ditto to that Pansy," Luna giggled "And I also recommend we build a mini mall for us so that way we wouldn\'t have to go to the mall in Seattle is that what the city is called Mione," she explained."It is and it could be private within the property we\'ll be extra discrete and if anything we\'ll put strong protection charms around the place,""Perfect," Hermione nodded at this "I agree I have been planning to do that either way and I\'ll have enough people to be the new teachers in the school which is even more perfect" she explained."New teachers?" Pansy asked all confuse"Oh right you didn\'t know yet I decided to be the principle in both Forks High and LaPush High as the head principle and their teacher. Luna, Draco, Blaise and Neville will be one of the teachers with me where we\'re going to change everything adding you guys into the mix it\'s going to be a wild ride?" Hermione explained."What do you mean?" Theo asked."Well her cousin Isabella is the student in Forks High but, she\'s currently staying with her mum in Florida for the summer so while she\'s over there we\'re going to change a few things in school. Instead of the first day in September we\'re going to change to to August 25th what do you think?" Luna explained."Brilliant I love it, is Ariel and Jay going to be the teachers there too?" Pansy asked."Of course since you and Ariel will be one two fashion queen teachers in that high school it would be brilliant no one will ever suspect the changes around town while I\'m going to make my cousin life a living hell being her teacher in each class well not all of them but, some of them yes," Hermione explained grinning."Sneaking and brilliant I love it," Pansy giggled turning to Theo who nodded in agreement "What do you think luv?" she asked."I love it I can\'t wait to cause some trouble for this cousin of yours Mya\xe2\x80\xa6 so, it\'s official we\'ll be moving to America being their new teachers while you Mya are going to be the head principle for both muggles schools and being their teacher I love it," Theo spoke up between the silence causing Hermione to nod at this "Pansy and I will arrive right before the baby shower which should be within 2 \xc2\xbd months from now you think you can handle that without us which I have no doubt you\'re going to create chaos for your trouble maker cousin right?" he smirked."Oh trust me Theo," Hermione began to say sipping her ginger ale drink "Not even Isabella or her little boyfriend is going to expect any changes until they arrive school and it\'s going to change everything for her little perfect life which is very doubtful," she explained."Let the games begin but, don\'t start any mischief without us I want to be there when it happens and I can\'t wait to build the Quidditch field I\'m excited to show the kids how to fly and all that," he explained.Hermione smirked "Oh please I can handle anything I don\'t know if you can handle living in a muggle town Theo considering it\'s my home town no less and we\'ll keep the mischief in a minimum and start causing all sorts of trouble for my dimwitted cousin and her boyfriend that they won\'t see it coming,""If I didn\'t know any better I would think you\'re a Slytherin under all that but, trust me I\'m a Slytherin I can handle anything especially if it\'s your home town Mya," Theo wiggled his eyebrows causing everyone to laugh while Pansy slapped him on the shoulder playfully "And we\'ll floo call you once everything is settled and let you know when we\'re coming," he assured her.Hermione felt touched by her friends and hugged Pansy "So I have a bit mischief in my blood I just don\'t show it off unlike some people and trust me we won\'t cause any trouble until you two arrive but, thank you guys for being my friend especially you Pansy I don\'t know what I\'d do if it wasn\'t for you guys," she whispered."Good, and of course, and I\'m glad we became friends Mya if we knew then when we were in school I probably would\'ve switch sides to the war," Pansy whispered as she softens her eyes "Best friends till the very end girls,""Best friends forever," Hermione and Luna whispered as they hugged each other.Pansy looked at the girls with a stern look "Always," she murmured."Till the very end," Pansy, Luna and Hermione all replied together."So I have an suggestion that I have for you only if your up for it Pansy?" Hermione asked."Go ahead?" Pansy asked."How would you feel on a job offer working in a magical school where you can be the Head Nurse for the students?""A magical school in a muggle town?""Yes, we\'re going to build one and I\'m going to have everyone who wants a fresh start have a job at the school,""I would say I\'d be an idiot not to take the job why?"Hermione grinned "Brilliant I was hoping you say that because \xe2\x80\xa6 I need a couple of teachers to teach non magic and magical kids who lost their families from the war\xe2\x80\xa6 give them hope for the future,""And who would be the Head Mistress or Head Master in this school?""Me?""You..?""Mhmm not only I\'ll be the big boss on both muggle high schools I\'ll be in charge of a magical and non magical school for our children to learn everything they need to know about magic and it will have a Quidditch Field which is even better,""A Quidditch Field? What houses names are you going to use?""I\'m still working on that bit but, I\'m sure if we can come up with the names it won\'t be a problem since you guys will also be in the teacher staff as I am,""Really?""Mhmm so what do you guys think?""Bloody brilliant. I would love that Mya,""Really,""Really it\'s like a dream come true can we also add besides magical classes we can also add muggle classes too?""Yes I was just thinking that it would be similar to the ones that we went to school In Hogwarts but, in different hours where we can get to pick a day for the classes and everything,""That\'s actually brilliant Mia when can we sign up,""Right now, as soon as I talk to Aqua about the projects we\'re building they\'ll start doing the construction asap,""Sign us up," Pansy grinned causing Hermione to beam as she grabbed the documents as they all signed them their names looking at the school name "Black Pearl of Magic Academy? Is that the school name that you came up Mya?" she explained."It is what do you think?""Black Pearl huh?""Yes it would make sense since it\'s inside my property of land in Forks,""Makes sense,"Draco gave Hermione a hand squeeze "I\'m glad to hear that you guys are coming and we\'ll be teachers in a magical school for our kids sounds even more brilliant," he announced clearing his throat "I don\'t want to be the bearer of bad news or anything but, did you guys found out the baby if it\'s going to be a boy or girl since it\'s been awhile since we last saw each other?" he explained.Pansy sighed "Oh yes we did Theo and I just came from our doctor\'s appointment today and we found out the baby sex?" she explained."Well what is it boy or girl?" Blaise asked.Pansy smiled mysteriously "Theo darling why don\'t you tell them since I know you been dying to tell them since we arrived," she explained."We\'re having triplets all boys," Theo happily exclaimed "And we both decided that we want you Mya and Luna to be their godmothers with your sister Ariel of course then Blaise, Draco, Neville being their godfathers with Fred, George, Charlie Weasley, and Jay Granger,""Are you serious that\'s awesome Theo and I would be honored to be their godmother," Hermione replied as her eyes light up causing everyone to laugh."Thank you, Theo, Pansy I would be honored to be the triplets godmother too," Luna told him being teared up."We\'ll be honored to be the triplet\'s godfather\'s as well," Blaise told them with Draco and Neville nodded in agreement."And I\'m sure Charlie, Fred, George, Jay and Ariel would be honored to be their godparents Theo, thank you for adding them into the godparents list," Hermione pointed out.Theo grinned "Of course they\'re our family and I\'m glad to hear that and I finally getting boys not that I don\'t love our daughters or anything but, still can you believe it," he cried out happily.Everyone congratulates the couple "Oh my gosh I\'m so happy for you guys," Hermione rapidly got up to hug her two friends "Your gaining triplets Pans," she gushed over this.Pansy giggled "Well it\'s more of Theo who wanted a son since we\'ve been gaining girls but, I\'m glad we\'re finally getting triplets all boys as long as our children are all healthy I\'m all good. We both decided to name after Greg, Vincent and Marcus\xe2\x80\x94Gregory Tyler Nott II \'Greg\' (OC), Vincent Blaise Nott \'Vince\' (OC), and Marcus Tristen Nott \'Marc\' (OC) after our friends in Slytherin," she announced"To baby Greg, Vince and Marcus," Draco announced."To baby Greg, Vince and Marcus," Hermione and everyone announced lifted their cups drinking. Once everyone started catching up; 2 \xc2\xbd hours later Draco decided to speak up during their conversation."So \xe2\x80\xa6 we\'re leaving in Friday huh?" Draco asked."Yes, we\'re leaving in 12:00 in the morning because our flight is in better than early then late since I don\'t want anyone to learn about our location. Kingsley setting up the port 3:30 am key and everything. I\'m going to go with Ariel, Fred, George, with their kids, then there\'s Jay, Charlie\xe2\x80\xa6 my kids\xe2\x80\xa6 then Tonks, Remus and baby Teddy along with Andie and I assume your parents coming along too right," Hermione murmured kissing her kids softly on the foreheads "Along with you guys of course," she quickly added.Draco nodded at this "Yes, Of course so that\'s\xe2\x80\x94" he counted in his head "Ariel, George with their children Percy II, Esmeralda \'Emery\', Arthur Corey II, plus the expected triplets William \'Billy\' II, Ronald \'Ronny\' II and Ginevra \'Ginny\' II to represent the Weasley family then there\'s Jay with his kids Logan, Zander, CJ, Sophia who are 14 years old\xe2\x80\x94being in 3rd year in Hogwarts, then Newton \'Newt\' & Nelson \'Nelly\' being in their 1rst year being twins being 12 years old\xe2\x80\x94then another set of twins Arianna & Hannah being 10 years old with their birthdays coming up and will be attending a different school in America like their siblings then there\'s Charlie, Fred Weasley, with his kids Barry and Ana Remus, Tonks, Teddy with the expected quadruplets being boys and girls," he paused causing Hermione to nod at this "Then there\'s us with our children along with auntie Andie and my parents that\'s a big group Mya. I remember you mentioned something about a relative back in the States, right?""I do he\'s my mum\'s older brother. My uncle Charlie, he has a daughter\xe2\x80\xa6 my cousin\xe2\x80\xa6" Hermione drifted off with a distant look on her face which wasn\'t unnoticed from everyone at the table "We don\'t exactly get along at all even when we were kids\xe2\x80\xa6 she was a bully if you will\xe2\x80\xa6" she murmured."Well we don\'t need her in our lives and if she ever starts any trouble, let us know and we\'ll get our revenge against the girl I remember you telling me about your cousin\xe2\x80\xa6 she sounds very awful," Pansy murmured at this then a grin showed upon her lips "If we\'re going to be her teachers\xe2\x80\xa6 we can cause a bit of mischief on her life \xe2\x80\xa6 that she won\'t get away with it that easily \xe2\x80\xa6 we\'ll make her life in school a living hell\xe2\x80\xa6 I love it," she explained.Hermione giggled "Oh yes I have plans on making her life in school hard and believe me she is ...he\'s even worse than\xe2\x80\x94 " she stopped causing Draco to flinch knowing where the subject was going "Well it wouldn\'t matter anyway since she\'s dead," she murmured."And thank Merlin for that\xe2\x80\xa6 she\'s bloody crazy," Draco murmured."Draco language children in the room," Luna scolded her husband."Oops sorry Mya," Draco gave a sheepishly smile which Hermione shook her head smiling, good thing the kids didn\'t hear that part or else she would\'ve scolded him as well "Sorry kids ignore that bit huh?""Ignore what Draco?" Teddy asked looking up as he was coloring with his cousins.Draco sighed causing Luna to be tutted at her husband "Now look what you did now he\'s going to wonder what we\'re talking about," she scolded her husband "Honestly Draco you\'re so lucky that Scorpius or the boys haven\'t picked that up," she explained with a tiredly sigh."Sorry luv," Draco murmured causing Teddy and the kids to tilt their heads all confuse with a shrug at this."Know what," Teddy tilted his head curiously tugging Hermione\'s jacket "I want to know auntie Minnie? Can\'t I know?" he asked."Nothing Teddy bear ignore your cousin Draco it\'s just grown up stuff," Hermione shrugged at this looking around the manor once more which left Teddy to pout and continued to eat while chatting away with his cousins "I should be done packing tomorrow and I also thought in Wednesday we can just have a small dinner get together before we leave ? I\'m not really in the party mood with a lot of people to be honest \xe2\x80\xa6.and in Thursday we can go to the carnival since I already bought the tickets and everything" she drifted off "What do you guys think?"Luna and Pansy looked at each other silently planning the party without her knowledge despite being Harry\'s birthday he would\'ve turned 23\xe2\x80\x94since Hermione is 25 due to the time turner in her 3rd year this coming Wednesday if he was alive; Luna however turned to Hermione with a daze smile "We would love that Mione would you mind if Pansy and I plan this event for this get together just us I mean?" she explained with hope in her eyes."I don\'t see why not since I\'m going to be too busy packing, so I won\'t have time to call everyone that\'s for sure. You don\'t mind terribly do you Lulu? Pans?" Hermione asked tiredly at this."We don\'t mind Mya planning the get together in fact," Pansy grinned "We\'ll make sure we won\'t tell anyone besides our friends that\'s for sure how\'s 6:00 in the evening for dinner sound," she explained."Perfect and no parties guys," Hermione giving her two friends a stern look "I mean it and thank you so much for making this happen for this small get together. I should finish packing since there\'s so much to do," she explained."Of course, of course you leave everything to us Mya and we know no parties Slytherin honor," Pansy waved it off "You keep packing while we take care of get together," she explained."Brilliant see you guys later," Hermione beamed as she went upstairs to pack while Pansy, Luna, Neville, Draco, Blaise and Theo silently had a silent conversation. Luna made sure she wasn\'t in hearing range after putting a silence charm around the kitchen turning to everyone."We\'re still having that party, right?" Luna asked."Absolutely, we just won\'t tell her about it," Draco grinned "Considering it\'s a surprise party," he explained."Brilliant. We\'ll split up on the people to invite in Wednesday since Mia plan to take us to the carnival with the kids for our last day in Thursday before we head to the airport in midnight for our flight, "Luna murmured grabbing her notebook out of her bag "The only people we\'ll invite is just Remus, Tonks, Teddy and the kids, then there\'s Charlie, Fred and George Weasley, Ariel, Jay with their kids\xe2\x80\x94Narcissa, Lucius, Andie, with Kingsley, then us, then Minerva, with the rest of the staff in school\xe2\x80\xa6are we missing anyone?" she asked."I think that\'s good enough for the get together Lulu," Pansy murmured "Theo make sure to keep a lookout on Mya in case she comes downstairs we\'re going to make it a surprise party as she\'ll be too busy packing to notice,""Got it," Theo nodded at this keeping a look out "The coast is clear for now Pans,""Perfect," Pansy waved her wand over the invitations "We\'ll have everything prepared by Wednesday agreed within three days since it\'s Sunday right" she explained."Agreed," Draco after taking off the silence charm that left everyone to nod at this as they bid goodbye to one another making Hermione think they already left.Once that was settled Pansy and Luna invited everyone on the list without Hermione\'s knowledge about the surprise party from the past 2 days preparing everything while Draco, Blaise, Neville and Theo took care of the charms, keeping it down low not wanting the press especially Rita Skeeter to find out because she tends to twist everything which neither of them wants that.Hermione packed everything in Grimmauld Place since Sunday\xe2\x80\x94she looked around checking seeing the manor empty for the first time as if she missed anything most of the furniture were inside her beaded bag with an undetectable extension charm on it and inside it held many possessions she and her friends would need during the hunt for horcruxes to destroy Voldemort and win the war because of it.One of those possessions was the Marauder\'s Map and the Invisibility Cloak which was from her last husband Harry\'s possessions but, since he\'s gone he gave it to Hermione personally. It came in handy whenever she goes shopping not wanting the press to find out. It\'s bad enough that they\'re following her every move but, neither did she and Harry wanted the quints to be in the middle of it which was why no one knew that she was pregnant or got married twice as they kept a low profile on both times.Hermione looked around for the last time and checked on the quints and the children who were sleeping in their beds for the night as she put a protective and silence charm around them; She kissed each of their foreheads and bid good night to her babies."Night babies," Hermione murmured "We\'re going to be leaving very soon and have a fresh start,"Once her head touched the pillow, she waited until it was midnight-why? Well it\'s someone\'s birthday-Harry Potter\'s 23rd birthday and he wasn\'t there with her\xe2\x80\xa6 they usually celebrate together with their friends and family but, with everyone that she knew killed three years ago it took some time as it was hard for Hermione and eventually she slowly moved on with her life not realizing that Pansy, Luna or their friends were planning a party in Wednesday evening-a farewell party to be pacific since they won\'t have time to do it in Thursday as they\'re going to the carnival as their last day before they move away from England to America to start fresh in Hermione\'s hometown Forks, Washington.Two days later it\'s finally Wednesday, Hermione decided to surprise her children by taking them and spend the day together with their uncle Jay who also happens to be their godfather with his kids who are quite close growing up with each other. James, Seth, Lily, Evie and Henry have the same birthday with Rose, Daisy, Amelia and Hugo being 1 day apart in August who are going to be turning 6 years old as they have different parents by bringing them to the zoo in Muggle, London so they can go shopping early in the morning and can have an early start on their day since she wasn\'t in a hurry, she brought the stroller inside her beaded bag so when she heads over there she can use the stroller so she wouldn\'t have to carry them the whole time or else she\'ll be tired and didn\'t want that.Hermione looked at the calendar as it stated July 31rst-Harry\'s birthday, she blinked her tears quickly not wanting to upset today since it\'s supposed to be a happy today and wanted to wake up early to get ready to surprise her children to the zoo as she has everything all planned for the day.\'Happy birthday luv\xe2\x80\xa6\' Hermione lightly touched her husband Harry\'s picture smiling in their wedding photo \'I miss you\xe2\x80\xa6\' she whispered as she went to the bathroom to take a quick shower, feeling her muscles relax from being too stressed from packing everything inside the Manor and dried her hair;she put some eyeliner, lip gloss and put on foundation around the bags under her eyes to look presentable and had her hair up with hoop earrings, some bracelets and a watch then strapped her locket around her neck since she\'s never leave without her locket as she had everyone she loved inside her locket including her husband Harry and her children."Mama\xe2\x80\xa6 mama\xe2\x80\xa6" James cried out causing Hermione to rush over to James and the boys room."Jamie Jam what\'s wrong," Hermione rushed over to her eldest son who whimpered reaching his arms wanting to be carried "Shhh it\'s okay Jamie Jam your momma is here," she whispered.James sniffed "I had a bad dream again," he whimpered.Hermione soften her eyes at her baby boy "What was the dream about luv?" she asked.James nuzzled wanting to be close to his mom "Bad lady\xe2\x80\xa6 hurt momma," he murmured."What bad lady baby?" Hermione asked causing him to whimper "Shhh it\'s okay luv \xe2\x80\xa6 tell me what happen luv?""Bad lady hurt momma\xe2\x80\xa6 she-sh tried to torture you\xe2\x80\xa6 screaming\xe2\x80\xa6 she-she-she killed you \xe2\x80\xa6 leaving us all alone," James whimpered "Sh-she was really evil momma...she hurt daddy\xe2\x80\xa6""Who baby? Who?" Hermione murmured."I-I don\'t know her name...but, she looked really scared momma?" James whimpered."Shhh\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s okay baby boy\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s okay it\'s just a dream baby she won\'t hurt you," Hermione bounced her baby boy trying to calm him down "I\'m not going anywhere not by a long shot\xe2\x80\xa6" she murmured."You promise?" James murmured."I promise always and forever," Hermione murmured holding her baby boy "Come on Jamie Jam let\'s get ready huh?""Where are we going?" James asked wiping his tears."It\'s a surprise come on," Hermione lips twitched "I have a big surprise for all of us today and we get to spend the day with you your godfather Jay,""Uncle Jay-Jay?" James perked up as he felt a little better from that bad dream; it tend to calm him down "We\'re seeing uncle Jay momma?" he explained."Mhmm\xe2\x80\xa6 we\'re also seeing your cousins Logan, Zander, CJ, Sophia, Newt, Nelson, Aria & Hannah they have\xe2\x80\xa6 and we\'re going to visit daddy with the Weasley\'s burials since Logan and your cousins\'s last day was yesterday so they\'ll be staying with us for a bit when we move to America together luv," Hermione explained."Really?" James asked."Mhmm so let\'s go get ready huh?" Hermione tap him on the nose causing him to giggle "Let\'s go put your favorite outfit for the day I bet your daddy would love that huh?" she explained.James nodded eaglery "Yeah," he happily cried out."Shhh don\'t wake up the boys it\'s still early let\'s sneak out quietly until they wake up huh?" Hermione whispered causing James to wince looking at his brother\'s bedrooms as it\'s connected to his as he nodded at this as she grabbed James clothes so she can take his bath.Out of her favorite jewelry would be her locket being her favorite from her husband Harry during Christmas it was when they decided to be a couple was probably the happiest day of her life besides getting married to her best friend although being the last of the \'Golden Trio\' has taken a huge toll out of her being a mother, a widow of quints James, Seth, Lily, Evie & Henry Potter while being the adopted mother to Ron and Susan\'s children\xe2\x80\x94Rose, Daisy, Amelia and Hugo Weasley-Potter no less was stressful but, thanks to Remus and Tonks she had huge help with her friends which she\'s thankful for. She made plans to spend the zoo with her children and Teddy\xe2\x80\x94and invited Jay and his children Logan, Zander, CJ, Sophia, then Newton, Nelson, Arianna and Hannah\xe2\x80\x94the quadruplets are turning 14 years old within a month, Newton and Nelson are 11 years old while Arianna and Hannah are 9 years old they\'ll be attending a different magic school like their parents did before they transfer into Hogwarts in Scotland who happened to be Hermione\'s godchildren altogether.By the time Hermione and James were ready to leave; Henry, Seth, Lily, Evie, Daisy, Rose, Amelia and Hugo woke up a few minutes later so James stayed in his room to pack his toys and his present for his dad and his relatives to visit him at his burial."Momma, momma," Henry whimpered."Yes Henry, what is it luv?" Hermione asked."Where are we going?" Henry asked.Hermione gave a small smile "We\'re going to visit your daddy, your aunts, uncles, and your cousins at the cemetery," she began to say cleaning the quints-Seth, Henry, Lily and Evie since James is now squeaky clean then there\'s Rose, Daisy, Amelia and Hugo were next since it\'s a huge group of kids for her to take care of and once they were done they went to pack their backpacks to give their presents to their parents-your uncle Ron and your aunt Susan Weasley who are Rose, Daisy, Amelia and Hugo\'s parents then James, Seth, Lily, Evie and Henry would give presents to their daddy Harry along with the rest of their aunts and uncles with their cousins who pass away three years ago."Momma?" Rose asked."Yes Rosie?""Is momma and daddy going with us too Am-amrica?"Hermione paused for a moment "America luv and yes, they are I decided to transfer their burials in Forks is that okay with you Rosie?" she explained.Rosie nodded at this "Yeah that\'s okay with me. I don\'t mind and I bet my momma and daddy won\'t mind too or everyone else wouldn\'t mind either," she murmured.Hermione soften her eyes kissing Rose on the head "I\'m glad to hear that, close your eyes I\'m about to put the shampoo on your hair luvs you too Lily, Evie, Daisy, Amelia close your eyes luv and then I\'ll do Seth, Henry and Hugo next okay," she explained."Okay," Rosie murmured doing what she was told."What about Jamie mama?" Daisy asked."He already took his bath before you guys woke up,""What about you momma did you took a bath?"Hermione lips twitched "I took a shower and yes I did. I woke up quite early before you woke up luvs,""Oh\xe2\x80\xa6where are we going momma?""We are going to visit your daddy, your parents, then your grandparents along with your aunts and uncles, cousins then we\'re going to see your godfather Jay,""Uncle Jay," Lily perked up "We\'re going to see him momma,""Yes Lilyflower we\'re going to see your godfather and he\'s going to bring Logan and everyone else since they\'re going with us to America in Friday,""Oh yeah\xe2\x80\xa6 I remember he told me that\xe2\x80\xa6 he seemed really sad but, he also said \xe2\x80\xa6 he\'s willing to give it a chance \xe2\x80\xa6 for uncle Jay\'s sake,"Hermione raise her eyebrow at this "Oh did he now? And what did you tell him Lily?""I told him that he won\'t be going alone since I\'m coming too," Lily perked up "He seems a bit relieved since he thought it was just him and his family but, I told him that we\'re going to move to America together since it\'s also your hometown right momma?" she explained."Yes, that\'s right\xe2\x80\xa6 I haven\'t been to Forks since I was\xe2\x80\xa6 13 years old\xe2\x80\xa6 so it\'s been a long time since I\'ve been home,""Is it\xe2\x80\xa6 fun there momma?""It has it\'s fun moments but, with your uncle grandpa Charlie he\'s going to take us fishing," Hermione explained."Fishing\xe2\x80\xa6 what\'s that momma?" Evie asked being the curious one besides her siblings."It\'s where you get to fish in the water\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s like \xe2\x80\xa6 you catch a fish, cook it then you eat it?""From the water?""Ocean, stream, or lake mostly...depending where you\'re going,""Oh...what else is there to do momma?""Well we can go Chuckie E. Cheese?""What\'s that?""It\'s like a mini theme park inside a building where you get to eat pizza, play video games everything," Hermione began to say explain what Chuckie E. Cheese was "And you know what else Lily," she explained."What?""In your birthday I have a big, big surprise for you guys,""Really\xe2\x80\xa6 what?""That\'s my secret luv\xe2\x80\xa6 you have to wait until your birthday comes,""But, that\'s soooo long momma?""Not for another two weeks luv,""Two weeks?"Hermione nodded at this "Yes, your birthday is in August luv remember?"Lily blinked her eyes owlish "Oh yeah," she giggled at this "I almost forgot my own birthday," she explained."Silly goose you forgetting your own birthday," Hermione tap Lily on the nose causing her to giggle as she went to wash every one as they\'re now squeaky clean with new clothes for the zoo and start their day today "Now you\'re all clean why don\'t you join Jamie in your rooms and pack your things so that way we can do whatever you want today okay," she explained."Okay," Lily, Evie, Henry, Seth, Daisy, Rose, Amelia and Hugo explained nodding at this while Seth stayed behind looking at Hermione their mother."Momma?" he asked."Yes luv?""Where\'s Forks?""In America you get to meet your godfather who you were named after?""Really?""Mhmm you were name after one of my best friends Seth Clearwater, he\'s going to love you bunches just like Henry is named after his grandfathers and godfather?""Who momma?""Jacob Black he happens to be your uncle Draco\'s cousin they met a few times but, they were pretty young then when I married your daddy he was in the wedding,""Oh that\'s really cool momma,""I thought as much now go pack your things so we can leave and visit your daddy okay,""Okay momma," Seth nodded at this as he went to his room "Momma can I pack my books too?""Of course Sethyboo go for it," Hermione winked playfully causing Seth to giggle as he packed his books and his favorite toys that he got as a child from his dad Harry before he got killed "Bring as many books as you want luv," she explained."Okay can I bring Padfoot with me?" Seth asked showing her his stuff animal."Bring as much as you want baby," Hermione winked playfully "Since I added an undetectable extension charm inside all your backpacks so you can pack as many things inside," she explained.Seth looked at his mum in awe "Cool\xe2\x80\xa6" he grinned at this as he went to pack all his toys inside his backpack as his siblings did the same in their backpacks "I\'m all packed now momma," he explained."Good now let\'s get some breakfast since I have so much planned for us to do today," Hermione explained as she and the children headed downstairs carrying their things.It\'s going to be a huge day for Hermione and Jay as they\'re both going to visit their spouse in the private cemetery while preparing their arrangements to switch in a different location near their place, so it won\'t be a hassle for either of them. Hermione wanted to have quality time with her children and that\'s what she did greeting Tonks, Remus and Teddy who was awake quite early today."Morning darling," Tonks wobbled her way to her adopted daughter; Kingsley told her and Remus that they\'ll be the guardians for Hermione, of the quints\xe2\x80\x94James, Seth, Lily, Evie, Henry Potter then there\'s Rose, Daisy, Amelia and Hugo Weasley-Potter which they didn\'t mind so they agreed with Charlie, Fred, George, Ariel and Jay "You\'re awfully early today? What\'s the occasion?" she asked."Morning mama Tonks," Hermione murmured "I\'m going to be out the whole day with the children with Jay and the kids. We\'ll be visiting Harry and the others then I\'m going to take them to the zoo, the park and then go to the mall to do a bit of shopping with the kids we should be back around 6:00 p.m. is that alright," she explained."That\'s completely fine," Tonks waved it off looking at her son "Do you mind terribly if you brought Teddy with you since I know he\'ll love the zoo and the park?" she explained.Hermione soften her eyes at her godson with hope in his eyes since it\'s now 4:30 in the morning so they had some time "I don\'t mind at all I was actually going to ask you if I can bring Teddy as well since I don\'t want him to feel left out," she murmured.Teddy perked up "Really I can come with you to the zoo auntie Minnie!" he giggled "Awesome I always love the zoo," he explained."Yes, Teddy bear we\'re going to the zoo to see all sorts of animals then we\'re going to the park and go shopping then we\'re going to visit your godfather Harry with your aunts and uncles who pass away over the years at the cemetery to pay our respects," Hermione tap him on the nose causing him to giggle "Why don\'t you take a shower while I make breakfast for everyone hmm?" she explained.Teddy pouted refusing to take a shower due to how early it was "No way,""Oh, why ever not" Hermione pretending to get along with him then gave a disappointed sigh "That\'s too bad teddy bear I guess your not a big boy then?" she explained.Teddy tilted his head "Because auntie Minnie I don\'t need to take a shower since I\'m too old or take a bubble bath and it won\'t be long till I go to Hogwarts within three years from now like mommy and daddy did," he explained.Hermione looked at Remus and Tonks who gave a soften sadden look "Just because your getting older that doesn\'t mean you have to be stinky when we go to the zoo, the park and the mall to get some ice cream Teddy bear and be naughty by not taking a shower while I get your cousins ready for our trip?""I\'m not being naughty auntie Minnie I just don\'t want a take a shower today it\'s too early," Teddy huffed at this looking away from his auntie who happens to be his godmother "Besides\xe2\x80\xa6I don\'t need anyone to take me a bath I\'m too old for that,""Then I guess we can\'t go to the zoo, the park, and go shopping or even visit your godfather Harry and the rest of your aunts and uncles with your cousins who are probably going to be very disappointment since it\'s a special day today,""What do you mean auntie Minnie?""Do you know what today is Teddy bear?"Teddy shook his head and gave a shy smile "No,"Hermione picked up her godson "Today is your godfather\'s Harry birthday today along with your uncle Nev since his birthday was yesterday but, we\'re going to celebrate both their birthdays today and since it\'s a very special day I thought we can visit him after we get ready to take a shower, by getting ready to leave so we can see him early before we head to the zoo luv and since we never got a chance to celebrate your uncle Neville\'s birthday I thought we can buy him a cake later today what do you think?" she explained.Teddy widen his eyes with a doe look "Really\xe2\x80\xa6 we\xe2\x80\x94" he felt sad that he lost his godfather Harry as he was always like a papa to him "We can visit uncle Harry today because it\'s his birthday today even uncle Neville while visiting everyone else too," he explained."Of course, luv I bet everyone would\'ve loved to see you and the kids to visit them especially Harry since today it\'s his birthday,""D\xe2\x80\x94do you think he\'ll mind if I give him his present auntie Minnie," Teddy murmured "Uncle Harry I mean along with everyone else,""I\'m sure he\'ll love it Teddy bear after all you were his favorite pup along with everyone else,"Teddy giggled remembering his godfather Harry "I\'m his only pup besides the quints and my cousins, right?""Right," Hermione nodded at this as she had a feeling it\'s soften up Teddy a bit "So\xe2\x80\xa6 does that mean you\'ll take that shower now\xe2\x80\xa6 so we can visit your uncle Harry?""No," Teddy huffed "No bath or shower," he explained."That\'s too bad because your uncle Harry would be very sad Teddy bear because if you don\'t take a bubble bath with your cousins then we can\'t visit uncle Harry along with your nana Mrs. Weasley and pop-pop Mr. Weasley with Bill, Fleur with the children, Percy, Audrey and their children with auntie Ginny and uncle Seamus with their children, your uncle Dean and your auntie Hannah along with your other nana Emma and pop-pop Dan from my side at the burial to pay our respects, then go to the zoo or the park then we\'ll go shopping and get some ice cream afterwards"Teddy titled his head "Why? I want to visit uncle Harry and visit everyone else, go to the zoo, park, go shopping and get ice cream auntie Minnie""Because you don\'t want to take a shower while I make breakfast for everyone and the only way for us to go is if you take a shower and be squeaky clean with your cousins to get ready for the day because after we visit your uncle Harry and the rest of the lot, I decided to take you to the zoo as a surprise for everyone and then once that\'s done we\'re going to the park maybe get some ice cream and if we have some time left we\'ll go to the toy store with your uncle Jay and your other cousins Logan, Zander, CJ, Sophia, Newton, Nelson, Arianna and Hannah since they\'re also coming along with us "Hermione shrugged with a dramatically sigh "Since I planned everything for today but, to do that you have to take a shower luv; so it wouldn\'t ruin the rest of our fun Teddy bear you wouldn\'t want that do you? It\'s a big boy\'s job to take a shower so you won\'t be stinky" she explained lightly as her lips twitched in amusement.Teddy looked at the quints and his cousins who looked very sleepy yawning then looked at his godmother debating what to do then he sighed with a pout "Okay auntie Minnie I\'ll take that shower with the rest of the crew so we can see uncle Harry to visit and pay our respects since I really want to tell him about my day and we can go to the zoo, the park, go shopping and get ice cream as promised right?" he pouted leaving Hermione to nod at this as he sighed kicking the floor much to his parents amusement "Alright I\'ll going to take a shower now," he explained crossing his arms.Hermione lips twitched "I\'m glad you decided you\'re going to take a shower Teddy bear being my good big boy that you are" she explained.Teddy nodded reaching his arms for his godmother "Of course auntie Minnie I\'m going to take a shower and get ready now\xe2\x80\x94 "he then turns to look at his mum "Mama, am I still your good boy?" he asked with his puppy doe look.Tonks giggled kissing her eldest son Teddy on the forehead "Yes, sweetheart you\'re my sweet baby boy and I\'m glad to hear that you\'ll take a shower luv so you can visit your uncle Harry along with the others, to pay your respects and head to the zoo, park and go shopping as much as you want with ice cream you\'ll have so much fun with your cousins," she explained."Okay," Teddy sighed heading upstairs to get ready to go out with Hermione and his cousins "Can I bring my backpack?" he asked.~*~End of Chapter Eight~*~*yawns* wow it\'s barely 2:17 am and I\'m already in Ch. 8 I\'m on a roll updating new chapters. I decided to change my schedule when I update. So instead of waiting weeks and weeks you\'ll see updates every 2-4 days each week sometimes early depending on how much I\'d finish my chapters anyway. Let me know what you guys think and if you noticed any errors please let me know so I can fix it and all that. Ciao for now dolls ^_^\nChapter Nine: Visiting Harry & the Weasley\'s Burials!"Yes you can bring your backpack and don\'t forget to pack your things since we\'ll be out the whole day,""Cool," Teddy nodded at this then turned around facing Hermione, Remus and Tonks "Auntie Minnie?" he asked."Yes Teddybear?""What time are we going home today?""Around six why do you ask?""Would we be able to do all of that today visiting uncle Harry and everyone at the cemetery, the zoo, the park, and the mall?"Hermione lips twitched "Of course we have plenty of time to do everything luv,""Okay I\'m going to bring uncle Harry\'s presents and everyone else okay," Teddy answered."Sounds like a plan Teddybear and don\'t even worry about over packing since I put an undetectable extension charm inside everyone\'s backpacks so when we go to the mall to buy stuff you can put them inside and don\'t have to worry being heavy since it will be light as a feather,"Teddy stared at his godmother in awe "Bloody brilliant," he blurted out.Hermione gave her godson a stern look "Language there\'s children in the room Teddy," she scolded him.Teddy flushed "Sorry auntie Minnie," he began to say causing his parents Remus and Tonks a bit amuse "I\'m going to get ready now," he explained as he raced upstairs to get ready leaving Hermione to shake her head in amusement while Remus and Tonks gawked at the girl."Sneaky," Remus chuckled at this "Very sneaky Snowflake if I didn\'t know any better I would think you\'re a Slytherin under all that?" he explained."I don\'t know what you mean papa Remus," Hermione began to say with an innocent look causing Remus to chuckle at this "I\'m going to make us some breakfast any recommendations papa Remus?" she explained."I\'m feeling for \xe2\x80\xa6 cinnamon waffles?" Remus asked."Coming right up," Hermione grinned as she went to the kitchen with the children following suit as they wanted some cinnamon waffles too "And I\'m also going to make sunny side up eggs, hash browns, toast with jam and coffee how does that sound papa Remus?" she explained."Sounds delicious why don\'t I watch the kids while you make breakfast so that way it won\'t be a hassle for you?" Remus offered."Would you really papa Remus it would help a lot," Hermione explained."I\'m happy to help you go make breakfast so we can eat huh?" Remus explained."Thank you papa Remus," Hermione beamed at this as she headed to the kitchen; it appeared that she was starting to get better little by little which is good since they were beginning to get worried over Hermione "What about you mama Tonks? What do you want me to make?" she explained."Anything is fine luv," Tonks began to say as they watched Hermione nod at this making breakfast while they talked by themselves in low tones "She\'s good I\'ll give her that much," she giggled as Remus kissed his wife fondly and rubbed her stomach gently "She\'s a natural at this, isn\'t she? Now I can see what Charlie meant\xe2\x80\xa6she\'s very sneaky and never gets caught" she explained shaking her head as she just witness Hermione jedi mind trick their eldest son Teddy."Yes, yes, she is," Remus murmured "And I\'m pretty sure Harry and the others will be proud of her too especially Padfoot and Prongs they\'d be proud if they can witness that," he explained causing Tonks to nod at this knowing the subject is sensitive for everyone.A few minutes later Teddy is now squeaky clean with fresh clothes and headed downstairs, so they can leave to the zoo. Hermione looked at the time as it stated 5:30 in the morning; they had some time since the zoo doesn\'t open till 8:30 so it was perfect for them to look around before the park opens. She grabbed the quints-James, Seth, Henry, Lily and Evie in one stroller then Rose, Daisy, Amelia and Hugo in the other with Teddy in tow to help so they won\'t get lost or run off."Alright you guys are now strapped securely and squeaky clean "Hermione murmured putting a stick-me-charm under her breath "Papa Remus, Mama Tonks we\'re leaving to the cemetery and won\'t see you until later tonight don\'t wait up," she announced."Have fun loves," Tonks called over from the kitchen "And take your time at the zoo hmm? Remus and I will be going to the doctors all boring stuff, then we\'re going to Diagon Alley to go shopping for the twins, so we\'ll be coming back late tonight depends on how long this will take," she explained."Sounds eventful, "Hermione strapped her beaded bag across her shoulder securely "Tell Jay that I\'ll meet him and the kids at the front of the zoo in case he tries to get a hold of me tell him to call me on my cell phone, beeper, or IPad okay," she murmured as she and the children apparated to Muggle London to meet Jay and his children."Will do darling and keep a close eye on Teddy as he tends to get into mischief apparently, he got that from his father," Tonks called after her causing Hermione to chuckle."Will do," Hermione murmured the minute she left with the kids to meet Jay and his children at the cemetery to visit Harry Potter, Ron and Susan Weasley, Arthur, Molly, Bill, Fleur, Victoire, who was a year younger than Teddy then Fleur learned she was pregnant again expecting a boy who she was planning on telling Hermione the name that she and Bill picked out only to get killed with the rest of the Weasley clan with their families and spouses with their children because they were instantly killed when they were attacked by the death eaters.Once she reached to the gate she murmured the password \'I solemnly swear that I\'m up to no good,\' and they entered the private plot of everyone that she cared about buried here, she felt it would\'ve been better if they\'re together instead of separate plots through their families. Hermione brought some flowers and found her husband Harry Potter\xe2\x80\x94she held her locket as her children\xe2\x80\x94the quints James, Seth, Lily, Evie and Henry bend down to pass flowers to their father."Hi papa," Lily murmured as Hermione blinked her tears away not noticing that someone was watching from the shadows "We miss you papa,""Momma is daddy in heaven?" Henry murmured as he reached his small arms to be carried by Hermione.Hermione nodded at this "Yes luv, your father is in heaven watching over us," she murmured then looked at Rose, Daisy, Amelia and Hugo who did the same with their parents "Rosie\xe2\x80\xa6 Daisy, Nia, Hugo why don\'t you give them your presents to your parents, grandparents, your uncles and auntie with your little cousins I\'m sure they would love that," she whispered."Okay," Rose murmured kneeling down on her parents Ron and Susan Weasley burial sniffing "Hi daddy\xe2\x80\xa6hi momma \xe2\x80\xa6 I miss you and momma very much we made you a drawing see there\'s me, Daisy, Amelia, and Hugo with auntie Minnie then Jamie, Seth, Lily, Evie and Henry are with papa Harry\xe2\x80\xa6 we miss you momma, we miss you daddy with nana Molly and grandpa Arthur, uncle Bill, auntie Fleur, our cousin Victorie with the rest of the kids, auntie Ginny with uncle Seamus, auntie Hannah, uncle Dean, their kids, uncle Percy and auntie Audrey with everyone else who passed away we made a drawing of uncle Harry too we couldn\'t find the right green color so auntie Minnie helped she said that we look like you daddy\xe2\x80\xa6 I wish you guys were here with us\xe2\x80\xa6 but, auntie Minnie is taking good care of us as our adopted mummy I hope you guys don\'t mind or get mad\xe2\x80\xa6 we love you\xe2\x80\xa6" she whispered as she gave a kiss on their tombstones."That was beautiful Rosie I bet your parents would\'ve love that along with the rest of your family," Hermione murmured giving a kiss on their tombs "What about you Teddy don\'t you want to give your present to your godfather I bet he would\'ve loved that," she explained.Teddy nodded at this as he bends down sitting on the ground "Hey uncle Harry," he drifted off as he felt someone watching from the corner and felt that familiar scent then furrowing his eyebrows "I got you something \xe2\x80\xa6 papa said that you\'re up there in heaven\xe2\x80\xa6 with your parents\xe2\x80\xa6 uncle Sirius\xe2\x80\xa6 and everyone else who lost their lives three years ago\xe2\x80\xa6 I can tell that auntie Minnie misses you very much\xe2\x80\xa6 even when she thinks that I don\'t know about it\xe2\x80\xa6 she would put this brave smile on her face not wanting me to be worried along with everyone else who didn\'t pass away yet\xe2\x80\xa6 " as he puts his present in front of his tomb while Hermione closed her eyes sadly wiping her tears and felt someone wrap her waist from Teddy "Don\'t worry uncle Harry I\'ll protect auntie Minnie and the kids for you\xe2\x80\xa6 we\'ll see you in Forks\xe2\x80\xa6 auntie Minnie said that she\'s going to transfer you guys to a different family burial in Forks\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s where nana Emma and grandpa Danny are \xe2\x80\xa6 I hope that\'s okay\xe2\x80\xa6 we love you\xe2\x80\xa6.and miss you uncle Harry," he murmured.Hermione kissed Teddy on the head "That was beautiful Teddy bear," she murmured as she looked up at the sky knowing her husband is watching over her and the kids along with everyone else "Let\'s make sure the presents don\'t fly away okay," she explained."Okay auntie Minnie," Teddy murmured as they put the presents around the tombs "Do you think uncle Harry would love his present?" he asked looking at his godmother."I\'m pretty sure he loves every bit of it sweetheart," Hermione murmured."I hope so\xe2\x80\xa6 aren\'t you going to say something to uncle Harry auntie Minnie," Teddy whispered.Hermione gave a sad smile "Of course luv\xe2\x80\xa6why don\'t you go visit your nana Molly and grandpa Arthur along with the rest of the family Teddy I\'m sure they would love that,""Okay, I\'ll be back soon," Teddy murmured walking to the Weasley\'s burial plot which wasn\'t far away."Momma Minnie I\'m going with Teddy to visit nana and pops okay," Rosie murmured."Of course, Rosie and be sure to stay together okay,""We will," Teddy murmured holding Rosie\'s hand along with Amelia, Daisy and Hugo who went with him while Henry and the quints stayed with Hermione to pay their respects with their father Harry."Momma," Henry murmured."Yes, Henry what is it,""I miss daddy\xe2\x80\xa6"Hermione gave a sad smile "I miss him too babes more than you ever know," she began to say holding her youngest son "Come on let\'s go say our respects to your father together okay," she murmured."Okay\xe2\x80\xa6""Hey Harry\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s Henry and I ... along with the kids\xe2\x80\xa6 which I\'m sure you\'ll probably know\xe2\x80\xa6 Happy Birthday luv\xe2\x80\xa6" Hermione murmured.[silence]\xe2\x80\xa6"Hi daddy\xe2\x80\xa6" Lily sniffed at this while holding onto her mum Hermione "I miss you\xe2\x80\xa6momma I miss daddy""I know baby girl\xe2\x80\xa6 I know I miss him

baby,""I miss you daddy\xe2\x80\xa6" James murmured "I wish you didn\'t have to die\xe2\x80\xa6 but, like Teddy said we\'re going to protect momma\xe2\x80\xa6 I\'ll make you proud\xe2\x80\xa6""He\'s already proud of you baby \xe2\x80\xa6""I hope so\xe2\x80\xa6""Why don\'t you join Teddy and stay together while I talk to your father\xe2\x80\xa6 I won\'t be long till I join you guys okay.""Okay

behind with her "Momma?""Hmm\xe2\x80\xa6what is it Seth,""I wish daddy didn\'t have to die\xe2\x80\xa6"Hermione murmured "Me too baby\xe2\x80\xa6 me too\xe2\x80\xa6let\'s go talk to your father okay,""Okay\xe2\x80\xa6"[silence] \xe2\x80\xa6"Sorry about that Harry\xe2\x80\xa6 you know the kids...

I wish it didn\'t have to be this way ... but, I guess it\'s part of the plan huh... God\'s plan... I never really believe that kind of stuff ... but, now I\'m not even sure to believe anymore... except move on..." she whispered.[silence] ..."I honestly don\'t know what to say\xe2\x80\xa6 except I really miss you guys so much\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s been so hard without you guys \xe2\x80\xa6 not by side especially you Gin\xe2\x80\xa6 you\'re my best girlfriend\xe2\x80\xa6 I know I have Lulu and Pansy but, it\'s not the same without you\xe2\x80\xa6" Hermione felt herself teared up holding her locket "I have so much to tell you Gin\xe2\x80\xa6 so much to tell you\xe2\x80\xa6 did you guys here\xe2\x80\xa6 George and Ariel decided to name their children\xe2\x80\xa6 after you guys Bill\xe2\x80\xa6 Ron\xe2\x80\xa6 and Ginny\xe2\x80\xa6they\'re expecting triplets ...two boys and a girl after you guys can you believe it\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s like nothing has changed with us but, I\'m just thankful that I didn\'t lose Lulu or Neville\xe2\x80\xa6since they\'re the only friends that I really talk too \xe2\x80\xa6 I know being friends with Draco, Blaise, Theo and Pansy was a little weird and awkward at first but, we\'re all friends now\xe2\x80\xa6 best friends...along with the rest of the lot who got killed during the war\xe2\x80\xa6" she began to say kneeling down touching Harry\'s tombstone and wipe her tears "There\'s just so many things that I want to tell you\xe2\x80\xa6 but, you probably saw that I\'m moving across the country in America\xe2\x80\xa6 in a small town called Forks\xe2\x80\xa6 to start over\xe2\x80\xa6 a fresh start\xe2\x80\xa6 for all of us\xe2\x80\xa6 do you remember how I told you about my home town\xe2\x80\xa6 Harry\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s my home\xe2\x80\xa6 at least for a little while\xe2\x80\xa6 I always miss visiting my uncle Charlie and now I don\'t have to do that\xe2\x80\xa6 because I\'m going to be living there\xe2\x80\xa6without missing him to much ya know... anyway \xe2\x80\xa6 I\'m bringing the children\xe2\x80\xa6 with me\xe2\x80\xa6 along with Charlie\xe2\x80\xa6 Jay\xe2\x80\xa6 his kids\xe2\x80\xa6 Fred\xe2\x80\xa6 his kids\xe2\x80\xa6 George and Ariel with their kids\xe2\x80\xa6 Luna\xe2\x80\xa6 Draco and their kids\xe2\x80\xa6 along with Neville and Blaise with their kids \xe2\x80\xa6 along with Tonks\xe2\x80\xa6 Remus\xe2\x80\xa6 Teddy \xe2\x80\xa6 Andie\xe2\x80\xa6 Narcissa and Lucius\xe2\x80\xa6 as you can tell it\'s a big group of us\xe2\x80\xa6 but, I think we\'re splitting up in small groups\xe2\x80\xa6 imagine that\xe2\x80\xa6 I hope you don\'t mind\xe2\x80\xa6 Ron\xe2\x80\xa6 Susan\xe2\x80\xa6 but, I love your kids to bits\xe2\x80\xa6 and I\'m going to do everything in my power to protect our children\xe2\x80\xa6. Gryffindor x Hufflepuff x Ravenclaw x Slytherin forever guys\xe2\x80\xa6 I love you guys so much\xe2\x80\xa6 Draco, Blaise, Theo, Pansy, Luna and Neville are going to help me relocate your new burials tomorrow\xe2\x80\xa6 despite everything I don\'t think I can live with myself not visiting you guys every day\xe2\x80\xa6 so I figure you should come along with me\xe2\x80\xa6 I hope you don\'t mind\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s a lot a process I know but, Draco and the guys along with me got it all planned out you\'ll be arriving at our new burials in Forks before we arrive in Friday\xe2\x80\xa6 you\'re going to be buried in Forks\xe2\x80\xa6 near my parents\xe2\x80\xa6 so that way we can be together\xe2\x80\xa6both in spirit and in our hearts I love and miss you guys\xe2\x80\xa6 goodbye\xe2\x80\xa6" she explained.That\'s when she felt small arms wrapped around her waist where Hermione looked down to see her daughter Evie "Momma," she murmured tugging her coat."Yes luv?""Who\'s that man mommy\xe2\x80\xa6.""What do you mean? What man""I saw someone by that tree over there,"Hermione looked over at the tree to where Evie her daughter was pointing too grabbing her wand as she felt her mother instincts but, didn\'t see anyone "Evie luv no one\'s there?"Evie frowned "No mommy he\'s over there,""Who?""I don\'t know\xe2\x80\xa6 he seems familiar like daddy\xe2\x80\xa6"Hermione frowned picking up her baby girl scanning around not seeing anyone since it\'s impossible for anyone to come inside since she\'s the one that created the powerful wards in the first place for this private location only to be relocated in Forks near her home\xe2\x80\xa6 she felt she wanted them to be close to her family which Draco and the others agreed with her."Come on Evie\xe2\x80\xa6 kids it\'s time for us to leave your uncle Jay and your cousins are probably waiting for us at the zoo," Hermione murmured as she felt her mother\'s instincts to protect the children from harm "Teddy luv let\'s go,""Okay auntie Minnie," Teddy nodded as he gave a kiss one last time to his friends and the Weasley\'s as his extended family."Teddy will you be a luv and set the strollers please and put the kids inside so it won\'t be a hassle when we head to the zoo,""Sure auntie Minnie," Teddy began to say grabbing James, Seth, Lily, Henry and Evie in one stroller then Rose, Daisy, Amelia and Hugo in the other "Let\'s set you guys inside huh," he explained."But, mommy I saw him," Evie protested at this whimpering "Teddy you believe me right?" she asked.Teddy looked torn "Of course kiddo," he murmured.Hermione noticed this as she bends down to the kids height "Sweetie you\'re probably imagining things \xe2\x80\xa6 even if it\'s your father\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s probably his spirit\xe2\x80\xa6 it tends to happen occasionally\xe2\x80\xa6" she began to say with a sigh "Come on let\'s go," she whispered.Hermione strapped her children inside the stroller expect Teddy as he was helping with the stroller pushing his cousins and left with Hermione the cemetery no one noticed that it was someone watching except little Evie Potter\xe2\x80\x94but, who could she possible see I wonder? Is it Harry\xe2\x80\xa6 possibly...but, not possible...right... so many unanswered questions filled in her mind but, she shrugged it off."You believe me don\'t you mommy?" Evie murmured.Hermione gave a small smile kissing her forehead "Of course I do sweetie\xe2\x80\xa6we should go your uncle Jay and your cousins are probably there right now," she murmured strapping the kids inside their strollers and apparated away to the zoo not realizing it was her husband Harry watching in the shadows as they left with a sad smile.Teddy however, scanned around as he felt someone watching but, shrug it off as it was only his imagination or something."Teddy come on we should go?" Hermione asked."Be right there auntie Minnie," Teddy murmured rushing over to catch up with his godmother Hermione and his extended cousins.However, a few feet away was someone shadowing; it was Harry Potter *gasps* apparently he was projecting, one of his powers \xe2\x80\xa6 he\'s been watching over his wife and children since it happened; he couldn\'t exactly communicate with her but, somehow he managed to get this far but, it wasn\'t enough. He really miss his wife Hermione and their children."Thanks Mia\xe2\x80\xa6 I wish we were celebrating my birthday together too and I miss you too along with the kids more than you ever know luv\xe2\x80\xa6" Harry began to say with a tired sigh "I wish I didn\'t have to hide from you\xe2\x80\xa6 especially for this long\xe2\x80\xa6 but, it was necessary\xe2\x80\xa6 since I don\'t want you and the kids to see me like this\xe2\x80\xa6 but, one day luv\xe2\x80\xa6 very soon\xe2\x80\xa6 we\'re going to be together again I promise\xe2\x80\xa6" he whispered as he disappeared from projecting from one place to another by hiding within the shadows.In the other side of the Wizarding World in Number 12 Grimmauld Place\xe2\x80\x94the minute Hermione, Teddy and the children left to meet up with Jay and his children once they went to visit the grave of Harry Potter, their friends and family who lost their lives 3 years ago\xe2\x80\x94Pansy and Luna apparated with a silent \'pop\' to Number 12 Grimmauld Place to meet up with Tonks and Remus Lupin who just picked up Andromeda Tonks, Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy who were helping with the decorations."Is she gone?" Pansy asked peeking behind the wall."Yes, she\'s gone for the day she decided to take the kids to the zoo then to the park, have ice cream and maybe take them toy shopping today," Remus began to say "Good thing it\'s Wednesday eh and decided to change the date of the party since we don\'t have time to have a party tomorrow except pack the last of the stuff inside the manor," he explained.Pansy nodded at this "Yeah it\'s a good thing Lulu thought about this ahead of time huh Lulu," she explained.Luna nodded at this "Oh yes, I saw this in my vision which is why I had a back up plan in case we decided to leave early," she explained."You and your visions," Pansy huffed at this causing Luna lips to twitched "It\'s a good back up plan either way," she explained."Of course," Luna murmured."Where\'s the balloons and the streamers along with the other decorations Tonks?" Narcissa asked."In here auntie Cissy?" Tonks announced passing the balloons and the decorations which Lucius caught it "Nice catch uncle Luc,"Lucius lips twitched "I\'m just going to pretend you didn\'t just call me that,""You know you love it," Tonks winked at her uncle causing Narcissa and Andromeda to snicker at this as they decorated the living room for the party "Besides\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s a good thing we\'re leaving this god forsaken place\xe2\x80\xa6 has so many memories \xe2\x80\xa6 " she whispered causing everyone to nod in silence."Brilliant it looks absolutely brilliant," Luna perked up "Neville can you bring the stuff please,""Sure Lulu," Neville replied as he and the boys grabbed the decorations and everything; it was a lot since Luna bought a whole lot of mixed different colors with different shapes and sizes; the cashier that checked the items out looked surprised by how much it cost as if it was normal for Luna and the boys."Perfect did you order the food?" Charlie announced as he just arrived in the Manor "Fred, George, and Ariel should be arriving soon bringing the kids and presents for Hermione, oh and Hagrid, Grawp his brother, Minerva McGonagall, Filius Flitwick, and Pomona Sprouts from Hogwarts are arriving around 5:30ish in the latest as they wanted to give their goodbyes to us before we leave," he explained."Yes, perfect, the food should be here, Ariel will be picking up the food for everyone," Luna explained."Good, good," Pansy nodded at this as her head of the house in Slytherin\xe2\x80\x94Severus Snape lost his life in the war so Autumn \'Ruby\' Collins, one of Hermione\'s childhood friend will take over as Head of the Slytherin House "Jay and his children are meeting with Mya and her kids to keep her occupied while we prepare for the party so we have eight hours before the party starts," she explained."Yeah, I just talked to him not that long ago he just came to visit Mal\'s grave with the kids, who paid their respects to their mother and Sophia their auntie, Arianna and Hannah\'s mother giving them their flowers and presents they set for them he should be meeting her now," Charlie began to say looking at his watch "Since he didn\'t have a babysitter so he figured he\'d take his kids to the zoo and spend some time with Mya since we\'re leaving this Friday together," he explained."That\'s fine and I just got the food," Ariel spoke up waving it off as she wobbled her way to the crowd carrying food trays by setting them on the table which everyone helped with the food trays full of food "Jay seems a bit better today besides taking care of his kids it\'s been hard on him," she explained.Charlie nodded at this "Brilliant the food smells good and yeah it\'s been hard on all of us but, he\'ll eventually move on with his life I\'m sure Mal would want him to be happy and take care of their children including himself Ariel besides\xe2\x80\xa6" he drifted off with a distant sad look causing everyone in silence "At least one of us is slowly moving on with our lives after losing a lot of our families\xe2\x80\xa6 it would be good for us to leave England and start fresh don\'t you think," he explained."Yes, it is especially for Mia," Ariel nodded at this knowing the situation at hand "Sorry I\'m late the line was a bit long when we went to pick up the food I hope we didn\'t miss anything," she explained sitting down."Nope you\'re just in time luv," Remus greeted his goddaughter with a hug not wanting to hurt the little ones "Hermione brought the kids with her and taking them to the zoo meeting with Jay and the kids, so she\'ll be gone for most of the day with Jay and his sons while we decorate and plan this party before their arrival" he explained.George smiled helping his wife with the food as she\'s carrying for four people being 7 \xc2\xbd months pregnant along "I\'m glad Mione is having fun Merlin knows she deserves it after what happen to\xe2\x80\x94 "he drifted off lowing his eyes downcast; everyone grew silent knowing what he meant "As much as I don\'t want to be the down in the dumps \xe2\x80\xa6 it would be good for her to start fresh in America," he explained.Ariel nodded at this in agreement "For all of us Georgie," she muttered.George kissed his wife on the forehead "Exactly and it would be good for us to extend our store after extending new buildings on our property good thing the yard is about 550,000,000 square feet acres long and wide don\'t you think Gred?" he explained."Infinitely Forge and we can even extend our shop inside the property inside the village that Mia told us about," Fred nodded at this whistled at this watching his kids Barry and Anya playing with their kids in the playroom while setting the presents down "Does she know about the party?""Nope she thinks Remus and I are going to the bank and to Diagon Alley to go shopping for the twins she has no idea that we\'re planning this surprise party," Tonks explained."Perfect, well what are we standing here for let\'s start decorating and we should start with the food as well," Charlie offered."Luna, Ariel, Pansy and I will take care of the food with the help of the house elves Kretcher, Daisy, Dobby, and Gun, My mum, auntie Cissa and uncle Luc will decorate the living room with the balloons and such where the boys will help out and please be careful with some of the stuff I know everything\'s all packed but\xe2\x80\x94"Tonks drifted off on the portrait of Mrs. Black; her estranged aunt "Sirius mum is still out there \xe2\x80\xa6although I haven\'t heard a peek out of her if I have to guess Mione put a silent charm or threw a hex on the frame but, I\'m not sure so we should be done before the guests arrive," she explained."I\'ll handle it luv," Remus assured his wife "And Hermione told me that she shrunk Mrs. Black portrait and send her to the Black vaults for safe keeping that\'s why you haven\'t heard a peep from her,""Thanks Remy," Tonks murmured giving him a quick kiss as they all split up to do their jobs "And good I didn\'t realize it she was gone until you told me,""And we\'ll help as well," Andromeda announced with Narcissa and Lucius to nod at this offering to help with the frame.In the other side of the Forks Ariel had a few friends that were fixing the Manor with the designs that they\'re picky, so they should be seeing the house now. Aqua who was one the of the designer of the house\xe2\x80\x94send pictures to both Ariel and Hermione before they see the place; the only things that needed to fix by hand was the walls that needed to be paint with a bright color, the floors needed a bit fixing, the garden, bedrooms etc which is why she asked Kreacher and the house elves to fix it up just the ones that doesn\'t look to hard for them to do.In a small reservation Jacob Black and the pack were patrolling apparently there\'s some vampires around not that it helped much but, it made Jacob slightly bitter over the whole thing as they met up at for summer school since they missed a few classes\xe2\x80\x94and needed to pass if they\'re going to graduate and all that. Since Jake was done with his last class he was heading home to sleep since he\'s tired until he heard his name being called."Hey Jake, wait up,"Jake turned around to see one of his friends Seth Clearwater, a young kid just like himself who always cheerful and wanting to hang out with the big boys it was before he became part of the pack including Leah Clearwater\xe2\x80\x94you can say that Leah learned about the imprint situation causing the former couple who used to be engaged more tension between them.Jake winced at this when Leah screamed at Sam that he should\'ve told her the truth before he cheated on her with her own cousin Emily. Unfortunately, Sam didn\'t say much about it but, knew it was causing a lot of tension in the air between the pack and let\'s not forget about Bella\xe2\x80\x94he didn\'t know what else to say about her being his best friend but, now\xe2\x80\xa6he wished he listened to his friends earlier or else he wouldn\'t be this bitter over the whole thing."Hey Seth, what\'s up?""Not much apparently our dad\'s been talking about something,"Jake titled his head curiously "Oh about what?""I have no idea \xe2\x80\xa6 all I can hear was ... she\'s coming back\xe2\x80\xa6 after 10 years she hasn\'t been coming to visit since she was 13 years old\xe2\x80\xa6the only people I can think was \xe2\x80\xa6Jay\xe2\x80\xa6 Ariel\xe2\x80\xa6 and Hermione although the last time we saw them was \xe2\x80\xa6 Hermione\'s wedding with her husband Harry \xe2\x80\xa6 and that was\xe2\x80\x94a few years ago\xe2\x80\x94" Seth drifted off with a distant look on his face; he always been fond and protective with her since we were kids along with myself, Leah and Sam, oh and my sisters too "How long has it been since their wedding?""About \xe2\x80\xa6 six years ago I believe why?"Seth sighed at this "I just\xe2\x80\xa6 can\'t believe she got married I always thought\xe2\x80\xa6 she\'d marry one of us though back home\xe2\x80\xa6.that\'s all,""It was\xe2\x80\xa6" Jake slowly nod at this "But, you know Harry\'s a good guy you remember we\'re good friends with him,""Yeah, I know\xe2\x80\xa6" Seth pouted kicking the floor "I always thought maybe\xe2\x80\xa6 me and Mia would\'ve \xe2\x80\xa6 been together is all," he muttered under his breath."Well I\'m sorry to be the bearer of bad news buddy but, she\'s married," Jake chuckled as he felt a sad tug in his heart towards Hermione too not realizing it will change their lives as he always had a soft spot for Hermione like Seth did "Besides from what I heard they\'re happily married we should be happy for Mia she deserves it," he explained."Yeah\xe2\x80\xa6 she really does," Seth smiled fondly over his best friend "I wonder how Mia is it\'s been a long time since we last talked to her," he explained.Jake chuckled knowing the kid as he always had a soft spot for the girl "You been talking about Mia a lot lately eh why is that huh and I heard from dad that she\'s coming here this summer?""I don\'t know it\'s just\xe2\x80\xa6 I can tell something\'s different this summer\xe2\x80\xa6 I can\'t explain it\xe2\x80\xa6" Seth began to say then stared at him in disbelief realizing what Jake said "Really she\'s coming here for the summer that\'s awesome," he perked up "When is she coming?"Jake shrugged "Dad didn\'t say you have to ask chief,""Wait you mean Charlie?""Well yeah that\'s Mia\'s uncle after all\xe2\x80\xa6 we saw Jay with his family a few years ago before we became a pack then Ariel but, no Mia apparently, she\'s busy with school to come visit and would go to her friend\'s house or something," Jake pointed out.Seth face fell "Oh yeah\xe2\x80\xa6 mom told me about that\xe2\x80\xa6we were only\xe2\x80\xa6 hmm how old did Mia get married again?""She was-" Jake began to say to realize he has no idea "Huh\xe2\x80\xa6 I would have to ask Charlie about that\xe2\x80\xa6" he murmured.Seth nods at this "Right but, I do remember we were \xe2\x80\xa6 maybe barely between middle school or high school somewhere around there when Mia got married to Harry right\xe2\x80\xa6" he sighed sadly kicking the floor like a sad little puppy then perked up; he doesn\'t stay sad that long and rapidly changed the subject "So...did your dad say when Mia\'s coming?""Nope but, I\'m pretty sure we\'re going to find out soon because whenever my dad talks to Charlie they would gossip like old ladies,"Seth chuckled "And when you add my dad into the mix they\'d gossip like old ladies in the reservation and Leah will agree to that sort of\xe2\x80\xa6"Jake snorted "Don\'t I know it\xe2\x80\xa6 so how is she?" he softly asked.Seth shrugged "As expected she\'s hurt, angry and a bit bitter but, I think she\'s slowly healing\xe2\x80\xa6 little by little but, whenever she tried to move on \xe2\x80\xa6 something always gets in the way\xe2\x80\xa6""Like how Emily would make out with Sam in front of her or whenever they make lovey-gooey eyes to each other or talk about the wedding and sometimes would add Leah into the conversation which would cause more tension, awkwardness with the rest of us kind of thing,""Yep pretty much sums it up,""Damn that must\'ve been hard for her to deal with it,""You have no idea\xe2\x80\xa6 ever since she found out\xe2\x80\xa6" Seth whispered not wanting anyone to overheard "She\'s been bitter\xe2\x80\xa6 and changed a lot\xe2\x80\xa6 she\'s not the same sister that I grew up with \xe2\x80\xa6and I miss the old Leah before Sam came along. If he just told her the truth none of this would\'ve happen," he bitterly spats with a snort " Just wait until Mia finds out she\'ll kick his ass you know how overprotective Mia is with Leah" he explained with a huff.Jake sighed not blaming the kid "Yeah\xe2\x80\xa6 I would\'ve felt the same way if Sam dated one of my sisters but, thank god that he didn\'t or else we\'re going to have a problem\xe2\x80\xa6and I\'m pretty sure if Mia were to find out what really happened between those three\xe2\x80\xa6 it ain\'t going to be pretty I know that for sure\xe2\x80\xa6 we both know how terrifying Mia is especially with her anger" he drifted off at this "Speaking of \xe2\x80\xa6 girls\xe2\x80\xa6 I uh decided to let her go,""Who?" Seth asked causing Jake to give a blank look which he winced after he noticed the look "Ah\xe2\x80\xa6 you mean Bella,""I rather call her Isabella thanks," Jake flatley replied."You do know she hates that name right," Seth snickered at this."I know\xe2\x80\xa6" Jake grinned evilly"Dude that\'s just evil," Seth snorted."She started it,""True\xe2\x80\xa6 not going to lie on that\xe2\x80\xa6 I don\'t understand why you would like her though she\'s not even pretty," Seth started to say noticing Jake gave a blank look "What? I\'m just saying the truth," he explained.(a/n: Sorry for the pause but I been getting questions from you guys who were confuse stating that why is Hermione is 25 years old-first of all Hermione Potter \'nee Granger isn\'t the same person that she once was because you all seem to forget that she just lost her late husband Harry Potter, Ron Weasley her best friends, then Ron\'s wife Susan Weasley\' nee Bones; being the parents of Rose, Daisy, Amelia & Hugo Weasley leaving them orphans that Hermione immediately gained full custody into her family not wanting them to be separated being their godmother only to learn that same day she lost the rest of her friends who she considers as family the Weasley\'s -Arthur, Molly, Bill, Fleur, their children, Percy, Audrey, their children, Seamus, his wife Ginny Finnegan with their children, Dean Thomas and his wife Hannah Thomas \'nee Abbott with their children who were burned alive inside the Burrow\xe2\x80\xa63 \xc2\xbd years ago thanks to the death eaters so obviously she aged from the time turner so yes she\'s 25 years old in this story but, her friends will think she\'s 23 years old since they don\'t need to know her actual age as she kept to herself.2nd of all) As for Jacob and Seth age being in high school well yes, Hermione is older than Jake & Seth by 4 years-age gap between them. However, Jacob was 13 years old, Seth was 12 years old when Harry and Hermione wedding to celebrate with their family and friends a small wedding Harry (19) Hermione (20) years old getting married for the 2nd time, however Harry and Hermione the first time they got married they eloped in their 6th year Harry was (16) Hermione (18) years old without their friends knowing about it except the Granger\'s who knew about the situation being the witnesses then so this happened wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy before Bella arrives to Forks since she was still living with her mom Renee that time so it had nothing to do with Bella or whatever since I really, really detest that girl with a huge passion and it didn\'t occur to Hermione to invite her cousin since they don\'t like each other AT ALL! So why in the hell would Hermione invite her when they don\'t like each other that doesn\'t make any sense to me at all!.The ones who survived 3 \xc2\xbd years ago Charlie Weasley, Fred & George Weasley are the only Weasley\'s clan that survived so how can Hermione be the same person from all of that so yes she\'s going to be 25 years old after everything she been through of course she\'ll be tired you\'d be stupid not to be. As for Second Wizarding War Hermione was only 19 years old when they won the war while Harry, Ron and the rest of their friends in their year were 17 being oldest tends to get confusing I know -_- I want to apologize in advance in case you get really confuse. And another thing for Hermione\'s job she\'s going to be the Head Principle in both high schools-La Push High & Forks High mixing it up a bit don\'t worry she has a lot of tricks up her sleeve when Isabella (Bella) and Edward arrive back to Forks only to learn they were 2 weeks late-they\'re up for a wild adventure trust me Hermione isn\'t the type of person for revenge but, with estrange cousin as their sworn enemies causing a lot of chaos in the magical community well\xe2\x80\xa6 let\'s just say Bella isn\'t going to be living in her own nightmare.I\'m sorry for rambling but, for that rude guest review whoever you are. You were pissing me off when you wrote that comment that I took off that review since I don\'t want any negativity in my story thanks! So please refrain from being rude huh thank you! As for the rest of you who always had been my supporter, follower and loving this story thanks ever so much for advance! Anyway let\'s back to the story huh! Lots of love sn0wyyyyyyyyyyy)Jake continued to give a blank look causing Seth to sigh "Dude\xe2\x80\xa6 I know she hurt you, toyed with your emotions and use you by breaking your heart but, seriously no need to give me that look I\'m just being honest\xe2\x80\xa6 you can even ask the guys they agree with me too," he defended himself on this argument "You remind me of Mia when you do that," he explained.Jake lips twitched "Mia huh? You do know she\'s happily married with a couple of kids right,""Don\'t remind me I would like to pretend that Mia isn\'t married with no kids right now thanks,""Why so you can have be the father of her kids," Jake teased him "And have children with her with mini wolf pups\xe2\x80\xa6""Shut up\xe2\x80\xa6""Uh huh\xe2\x80\xa6and I bet those kids are going to have a great father but, I have to break it to you man she\'s married\xe2\x80\xa6""I know... believe me I know,""And I know you miss her hell I miss her too but, we can\'t expect her to not fall in love right?""Right\xe2\x80\xa6 but, it\'s Mia.. ya know\xe2\x80\xa6 and I\'m not the only one who likes her to Jake,""Oh come on Seth\xe2\x80\xa6 it was just a crush-" Jake sighed noticing Seth glower look "Okay...okay I admit I did have feelings for Mia and even if she felt the same way or even considered dating either of us \xe2\x80\xa6 it wouldn\'t happen because she\'s happily married \xe2\x80\xa6 and it\'s not like she would think of me that way...she always been a mother figure to me ever since my mom died she always made sure that I was extra cared for,""I know she did but, don\'t think I didn\'t see you stare at Mia as if she was angel when she walked down the aisle too and I honestly think you\'re wrong. I overheard Mia telling Leah that she did have a crush on both of us once,""She did?""Yeah you can ask Leah she was on the brides maid when that occurred,""Oh yeah and we were the groomens right?""Right and even if she\'s not married I\'ll always care about her married or not,"Jake chuckled remembering that day "Yeah I know\xe2\x80\xa6 but, she\'s married so we can\'t really do anything Seth,""I know\xe2\x80\xa6" Seth bowed his head kicking the floor sadly but, rapidly changed the subject "And as for the girls in this town Mia is better looking that Bella," he argued back.Jacob rolled his eyes knowing Seth being stubborn and protective over Mia "Oh come on man are you telling me that you and the guys don\'t like Bella at all,""Yeah pretty much even I have my limits with the girl\xe2\x80\xa6 and I\'m not even friends with her\xe2\x80\xa6I bet Mia can kick her ass""Well yeah, she\'s pretty much stronger then Be\xe2\x80\x94Isabella even Leah can kick her ass along with my sisters Rachel and Rebecca since they all hate the girl ya know," Jake argued back.Seth snorted "Don\'t even get me started with Leah when I asked her if she was a guy would she think Bella is attractive she gave me this blank look eating her banana and-" he was cut off by Jacob with a weird look "What?""Leah was eating a banana?\'"Yeah she was eating \xe2\x80\xa6a banana\xe2\x80\xa6.she was hungry okay,""Uh huh right... and what about Leah?""She told me that if she was a guy or a lesbian she would never in a million years ever think that Swan-(Bella\'s name from Leah) ever think that she was attractive enough to be beautiful, pretty, cute, or hot because she\'s wayyyyy to plain, weak, whiney, manipulative, selfish control freak, cold hearted bitch and a huge klutz for her taste that\'s not even close to her type of girl to date and hates the girl in a huge passion,""Huh\xe2\x80\xa6""I know I was shocked as you were, and I think she may\'ve made Paul and the rest of the guys stunned by that statement too,""Really\xe2\x80\xa6?""Yeah true story it only happened 2 days ago,"Just before Jake was about to answer that\'s when the bell rang for everyone to head home."Hey what time is your patrol?""Around 11 you?"Seth shrugged "Sam wants us to double patrol again, so I would say around 11 same as you,"Jake frowned "That can\'t be right\xe2\x80\xa6 since we all got summer school we can\'t miss anymore days than we did when we were in school,""I know that\'s what I told Sam but, he won\'t listen to anyone until Leah told him that we have to go back to school and not miss anymore or else we won\'t graduate and told him off by changing his mind for us to balance our patrol sessions because of it. I don\'t know how but, I guess it\'s his way of trying to get back in her good graces or at least be her friend \xe2\x80\xa6 which we both know since that isn\'t going to fix things between them since the damage is already done,""How?""I have no idea\xe2\x80\xa6 but, from what I can tell it was from Leah\'s stare\xe2\x80\xa6 he can\'t seem to argue with her\xe2\x80\xa6after the whole thing?""Really?""Yep,""Wow\xe2\x80\xa6""That\'s what I said but, then again no one can ever say no to Leah\'s stare it\'s scary I think she got that from our dad though,""What makes you say that?""Because our dad has the same stare whenever Leah and I get in trouble\xe2\x80\xa6 and we end up given in the whole thing,""Again \xe2\x80\xa6 wow\xe2\x80\xa6""Exactly,""So, what are you going to do for the time being before we head to patrol?""Probably do homework you?""Sleep I haven\'t been sleeping that well \xe2\x80\xa6""Ah\xe2\x80\xa6I get it\xe2\x80\xa6 I haven\'t slept that well either but, I think Leah will let me sleep before we head to patrol after school since her patrol isn\'t till tonight,""Sounds like a plan,"Jake and Seth exit their school to meet up with their friends Embry, Quil, Jared, Paul at their school while Leah, Sam, and Jared would patrol taking turns in their study period."Hey there\'s Sam over there," Seth asked."Yeah I can see that," Jake muttered under his breath with a raise eyebrow "Hey Sam,""Hey Jake, Seth," Sam slowly nod at this leaning against the wall "Change of plans in patrol?""Oh...is something wrong?" Seth began to say then panicked "Hold on don\'t tell me we have to more than double shifts in patrol too it\'s already hard enough that I didn\'t get enough sleep because of it," he explained.Sam shook his head at this "Nah nothing\'s wrong\xe2\x80\xa6 you were right...about changing our patrol schedules \xe2\x80\xa6 " he shifted uncomfortable noticing Leah\'s glower icy look as he scratch his head nervously "I know I\'ve been extra tense lately with patrols and everything but, I changed the schedules for you, Seth, Embry, Quil, Brady and Collin since you guys got school for the afternoons while Paul, Jared, Leah and I will take the evenings so it wouldn\'t be so tiring for you guys," he explained."Since when do you want change patrol schedules you even said we had to do more double patrols then before and kept insisted about the whole thing," Jake argued back.Sam looked at Leah who gave him an icy look in return and huffed looking away "Let\'s just say I don\'t have a choice in this matter just be grateful I even changed my mind in the first place," he explained."Uh\xe2\x80\xa6 " Jake stared at him weirdly "O..kay\xe2\x80\xa6 thanks Sam\xe2\x80\xa6 it actually helps to get some sleep too...so\xe2\x80\xa6 thanks \xe2\x80\xa6""Don\'t thank me \xe2\x80\xa6 thank Leah," Sam pointed out causing Jake and Seth to blink their eyes owlish.~*~End of Chapter Nine~*~Whooooooo I finally finish this chapter finally it took a while but, I did it. I\'m sorry for taking so long but, I had to rewrite some of the chapters to update again hopefully it would help a lot now and I\'m now back to where I last stopped. Maybe then I\'ll have some new reviews from everyone let me know what you guys think. Ciao for now dolls ^_^\nChapter Ten: ZSL London Zoo (Part 1)However, when Sam left to patrol around the school while Jacob and Seth turned to see where Leah was but, by the time they turned she wasn\'t there at her original spot apparently she left before they knew about it."I\'ll see you guys later," Sam murmured that it made Seth and Jake to blink their eyes owlish realizing that Sam left."Hey where Leah and Sam go?" Jake asked."I don\'t know," Seth shrugged at this "She\'s probably in class or something but, what that about though and I think Sam is probably patrolling around the school\xe2\x80\xa6" he explained.Jake shrugged at this "I wish I know but, at least we got our patrol changes\xe2\x80\xa6 we should thank Leah I guess she\'s just overprotective since we got school," he pointed out."Yeah \xe2\x80\xa6 maybe\xe2\x80\xa6" Seth murmured as they both exit heading inside their school to meet up with the guys who gave their famous handshake."So \xe2\x80\xa6 I heard we got our patrols schedule changed again," Paul complained at this sipping his soda."At least it\'s better than nothing we still got school I want to at least graduate and go to college still," Seth pointed out."You do know we can\'t leave the reservation right\xe2\x80\xa6?""Yeah I know \xe2\x80\xa6 but, I want to at least go to a good college\xe2\x80\xa6"Paul grew quiet "Yeah\xe2\x80\xa6 me too\xe2\x80\xa6 even Rae even insisted I try out the colleges too\xe2\x80\xa6 "Jacob sighed which Paul and the guys noticed "You okay Jake?" Embry asked."Yeah\xe2\x80\xa6 yeah I\'m fine I just haven\'t been sleeping well," Jake yawned rubbing his eyes as the guys can tell he has bags under his eyes "I just need to sleep for a bit and I\'ll be good to go," he explained."You sure?""Yeah I\'m sure\xe2\x80\xa6 besides at least our patrols schedule changed thanks to Leah I think \xe2\x80\xa6 she may\'ve yelled at Sam for us who still have school,"Jared raised his eyebrow at this "Oh yeah\xe2\x80\xa6 why?""Hell would I know," Jake shrugged at this "It\'s better than my patrol schedule I just want to keep myself distracted by \xe2\x80\xa6 other things\xe2\x80\xa6" he murmured."I think you\'re better off without her Jake," Paul pointed out "There are better looking girls than Swan," he snorted at this "And I mean better looking women," he explained.Jacob eyes harden "Don\'t let my sister hear that...your lucky she\'s my sister," he muttered under his breath.Paul sighed tiredly "Yeah I know I\'m still working on that but, seriously Jake I bet there\'s plenty of girls who want to go out with you," he argued back."He\'s right you know," Quil pointed out."Yeah. yeah, yeah," Jake waved it off heading to class as everyone followed suit as the bell rang for their class to begin; in their study period Jake and Seth exit their school to meet up with their friends Embry, Quil, Jared, Paul then there\'s Leah with Sam waiting for them at the forest as they have the afternoon patrol after school thanks to Leah\'s influence neither of the guys knew what made Sam changed his mind over the patrols but, whatever it was-they appreciated it even if they don\'t show it towards Leah although it was a bit odd even for her but, it made the guys happy during the patrols not realizing that Sam, Leah, Jacob\'s and Seth\'s childhood friends Hermione Potter, Jayden Granger and Ariel Weasley \'nee Granger are heading home to Forks within a few hours."Hey Paul, Jared come over here a second?" Tai one of Jay\'s friends asked calling them over."Oh hey Tai what\'s up?" Jared asked."Here," Tai began to say giving the new class schedule for the semester "This is for the new school,""School what school?""The one in Forks, High apparently we have a new boss so she wants to give out the new schedules for the classes and everything?""What but, I thought our first day isn\'t till September?""Not anymore she changed it to August 25th,""That\'s in a month?""Actually 3 \xc2\xbd weeks and she changed the school schedule as well,""What do you mean?""Like instead of school beginning around 8:10 a.m. it starts in 7:30 in the morning and the classes instead of six it\'s eight classes and the school ends around 5:00 p.m,""WHAT she can\'t do that,"Tai chuckled lowly "Actually she can. She owns the school both schools Forks High and LaPush High so technically she can do whatever she wants since she\'s the boss and since LaPush High is under construction the students who attended in LaPush have to continue attending Forks High for two years instead of one,"Paul and Jared gawked at him "But, I thought the construction in LaPush is already build already why would they want the rest of us to attend to LaPush High in two years,""She can\'t just automatically buy the schools and change everything,""Yes she can it\'s her home town she can do whatever she wants and Chief Swan he approvals,""WHAT!? Chief Swan knows about this,""Of course he does, they\'re very close catch you guys later," Tai grinned and walked away causing Jared and Paul to gawk at the guy along with the rest of the pack "I got a lot of \xe2\x80\xa6 notice letters to give out to the parents and students in this town including the reservation of LaPush," he explained."What the hell just happen!?"(a/n: I bet you guys didn\'t expect that-let\'s just say Hermione is very prepared she has Tai, Ruby, Aqua to help out in the background, has her friends to attend Forks, High as the new teachers and with her being head principle-Jay and Ariel will be assistant co-principles in both Forks High and LaPush High reservation and the town is up for a wild ride)[Forks, Washington\xe2\x80\x94Cullens residence] \xe2\x80\xa6Alice was humming to herself reading one of the latest bridal magazines to find some inspiration for Bella\'s dress since she had her vision that Bella will be in the Cullen family she wanted to be extra sure that it would come true because she really believed that Bella is the one for Edward even if her family didn\'t think so, they didn\'t say it to Edward\'s face but, she can tell that her adopted parents Carlisle and Esme Cullen were keeping their distance over Bella ever since they came back from Italy.Even her husband Jasper seemed distance towards Bella not that they were ever close but, still she had hoped that they would become close when she saw Bella as a vampire in her vision. As for Rosalie she knew that she didn\'t like the girl because Bella was being selfish, wanting to be with Edward for entirety and giving up her human life to become immortal like them and then there\'s Edward, the pack and the treaty to reconsider."Alice\xe2\x80\xa6" Rosalie asked."Yes Rosie," Alice answered."What are you up too?" Rosalie asked raising her eyebrow at her sister."Nothing sister dearest," Alice beamed humming to herself causing Rosalie to roll her eyes in annoyance knowing her."I don\'t believe you spill," Rosalie demanded on her sister.Alice grinned "Bella will become a Cullen Rosie we get another sister isn\'t that great," she exclaimed.Rosalie face became blank after that statement "Oh\xe2\x80\xa6 that\xe2\x80\xa6" she grumbled turning to her husband Emmett who was playing games with Jasper "Emmett do you want to go hunting today it\'s grizzly bear season,"Emmett grinned "Hell yes, let\'s go baby," he happily cried out after he beat Jasper causing him to grumble and raced off with Rosalie to the woods leaving Alice and Jasper alone; well Alice was pouting."I just don\'t understand why she still hates Bella she\'s a nice person," Alice pouted "Right Jazzy?"[no answer] \xe2\x80\xa6"Jazzy?""Hmm\xe2\x80\xa6""You like Bella, don\'t you?""I wouldn\'t say\xe2\x80\xa6 like is a strong word Alice,""Why not\xe2\x80\xa6""There\'s something off about her\xe2\x80\xa6 but, I can\'t really tell since her emotions are usually about jealousy, envy, or selfish,""What do you mean?"Jasper shrugged "I\'m not sure\xe2\x80\xa6 her emotions were changed after she got back together with Edward\xe2\x80\xa6 I thought it was just nerves but, now I\'m not so sure but, I have a feeling it\'s not over yet Alice" he paused for a moment "Did\xe2\x80\xa6 you had any visions lately,""No not recently mostly it\'s about Bella and why didn\'t you tell me this before?"Jasper just nodded "I thought it was just in my head and didn\'t want to cause any tension but, now it\'s different\xe2\x80\xa6.and I had a feeling you say that\xe2\x80\xa6 I\'m going to head out,""What are you trying to say Jazzy\xe2\x80\xa6 like her emotions changed drastically the minute Edward and Bella got back together\xe2\x80\xa6""I can\'t say for sure\xe2\x80\xa6 but, all I know something is different\xe2\x80\xa6 and I\'m not sure if it\'s a good thing or a bad thing\xe2\x80\xa6""Where are you going?""Hunting, I need to hunt,""Well I\'ll go with you,"Jasper grinned nodding at this as they raced off to the woods to go hunting not noticing that Esme just got home with an off feeling in her stomach but, hasn\'t said much yet. At the woods Rosalie and Emmett were hunting but, Rosalie felt something off around the woods\xe2\x80\xa6"Emmett\xe2\x80\xa6""Yes, angel?""Do you feel something off about the woods\xe2\x80\xa6"Emmett frowned at this as he ate the grizzly bear "Not \xe2\x80\xa6 that I know of why?""I just feel like someone\'s watching \xe2\x80\xa6 with an off feeling in my stomach \xe2\x80\xa6""Well there\'s no one in the woods except you, me, Jasper and Alice who are hunting in the other side of the forest that\'s for sure since we own this part of the woods then the other half is where the pack own that part of the woods,""True\xe2\x80\xa6 but, then we have the mutts to consider\xe2\x80\xa6 considering they\'re attending Forks High as we are \xe2\x80\xa6 because their school is under construction, so they have no choice to transfer,"Emmett nodded at this kissing her shoulder "It\'s going to be fine babe, you worry too much,""Maybe...do you think it\'s a good idea for Bella to be in our family Emmett?"Emmett shrugged "She\'s okay to be around with,""But, do you want her in our family. I get that Edward wants to be with her but, why even bother breaking with the girl last year if they\'re going to end up back together anyway, she\'s nothing but, trouble Em," Rosalie scowls "I mean seriously she\'s not that pretty and doesn\'t even have any hobbies except hang out at the house," she explained with a huff."It was the only way to protect her Rosie you know that,"Rosalie snorted "Oh please we both know that\'s not true,"Emmett frowned "Babe come on you\'re still not jealous over the fact that Edward pays attention to her then with you, are you?""No not really I\'m not jealous of Bella Em. I\'m just saying ever since she became part of our lives we shouldn\'t endanger our family because of her. Even Jasper, Carlisle and Esme can see that ever since we got separated last year and that Edward had to be dramatic over the Volturi thinking that Bella died,""Which you told Edward because Alice saw a vision of her jumping off the cliff," Emmett pointed out."Which I apologized for that but, I didn\'t think she would jump off the cliff only because some kids are doing it too,"Emmett pondered for a moment "I know where you\'re going with this but, Edward\'s been alone for a long time before Bella came into the picture why can\'t you be happy for our brother,""I want him to be happy Emmett but, not with Bella," Rosalie scowls looking away "There\'s something\xe2\x80\xa6 off about her\xe2\x80\xa6 I can\'t make it out but, I don\'t like it,""Why not with Bella though she\'s Edward\'s singer?"Rosalie sighed "Do you not remember when she first came here to Forks 2 years ago?""Of course, she was shy and awkward, until she noticed us coming into the cafeteria," Emmett pointed out."Exactly Edward and Jasper couldn\'t read anything off her, mostly Edward because he can read people\'s thoughts right,""Right\xe2\x80\xa6.""And yet he couldn\'t read hers,""Well Edward can read Bella\'s dad Charlie though,""Not since last year Emmett ever since we got back Charlie\'s mind is blocked like Bella\'s,""What are you trying to say Rosie that Bella\'s dad Charlie\'s mind is blocked from Edward\'s abilities or something,""I don\'t know yet but, I\'m willing to find out ... what the hell is going on because I don\'t like this feeling anymore Em\xe2\x80\xa6"Emmett soften his eyes holding his wife and kissed her on the forehead "Hey look at me\xe2\x80\xa6. I know you don\'t like Bella but, she\'s good for Edward Rosie\xe2\x80\xa6 she\'s going to be part of our family either we like it or not,""So, you don\'t want her in our family then,"Emmett sighed "No, I don\'t but, it\'s not what we want\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s what Edward wants and if he wants to be with Bella then we have to be supportive for our brother and you heard what Alice said Rosie\xe2\x80\xa6 she saw Bella in her vision becoming a vampire like us,"Rosalie scowls "Yeah \xe2\x80\xa6 I know,""Come on you should hunt you haven\'t had anything since this morning hunt,""Okay," Rosalie murmured as they both speed off to hunt some more.In the other side of the world, in London, England more specifically- Hermione was sitting on the beach feeding the children in the ZSL London Zoo in muggle London\xe2\x80\x94James, Seth, Lily, Evie and Henry (the quints) along with Rose, Daisy, Amelia & Hugo and Teddy were eating their snacks with their breakfast waiting for her big brother Jay with his kids."Mya! Mya! Over here!" Jay began to say waving his sister while carrying his youngest daughters who happens to be his nieces and goddaughters Arianna and Hanna on their backs who seemed pretty tired due to how early it was and set them down once they reached to Hermione and her children, Newton and Nelson being twins were holding their dad Jay\'s hands then his eldest children being quadruplets \'quad\'s\'\xe2\x80\x94Logan, Zander, CJ and Sophia greeted their favorite godmother and auntie by hugging her who returned the gesture to her godchildren "Sorry we took so long we were visiting\xe2\x80\x94""Mal at the cemetery like I did when I visit Harry along with the others with my children I know you don\'t have to explain yourself if your late or not I\'m just glad you\'re here that\'s all it\'s been so long since we get to hang out as much," Hermione explained.Jay gave a sheepishly smile "Sorry about that nugget being busy, as a single widow dad tends to get me busy and I didn\'t want to miss anything," he nodded at this not noticing that his hair was a bit messy as he lowered his voice "Speaking of burials I just bumped into Aqua and Ruby who arrived at the burials about an hour ago they\'re preparing to transform their burials back in Forks next to mum and dad as we speak so they should be arriving when we do in Friday," she explained.Hermione nodded at this as she\'s glad that she\'s transferring everyone\'s burials in Forks, Washington she didn\'t want to take any chances "And don\'t even worry about it you\'re not late at all Jay and I\'m just glad you can make it from your busy schedule," she paused for a moment looking at her watch "Brilliant I\'m glad we managed to relocated Harry and everyone else in Forks\xe2\x80\xa6 do you think it\'s \xe2\x80\xa6 legal to do that Jay I don\'t want to get in trouble for this," she explained."It\'s legal to do that as long as the owners are fine with it which uncle Charlie is fine since there\'s a lot of room in Forks then down here and I\'m pretty sure Harry, Ron, Susan, Mal along with the rest of the lot are fine with it too," Jay began to say rubbing Hermione\'s shoulders to relax "Relax Mya they\'ll be extra protected I\'ll make sure of it," he explained."Good\xe2\x80\xa6 and how are you liking being a single father for this long\xe2\x80\xa6?" Hermione murmured.Jay sighed "Yes well-being a single father tends to keep me busy but, I can see the quints and the children got you busy too along with Teddy of course and \xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s been a bit lonely wait-let me rephrase that I\'m not always lonely I still have the kids when they\'re not in school but, Charlie always kept me company whenever he comes to visit," he explained."You guys are close huh?" Hermione gave a sly smirk causing Jay to chuckle at this "And of course they are they\'re all my babies," she explained.Jay grinned "Well yeah we\'re best friends and what\'s with the look huh nugget?"Hermione gave an innocent shrug "I just noticed that you and Charlie been hanging out a lot\xe2\x80\xa6 any sparks between you two?" she asked fluttering her eyes at her causing Jay to flush."No," Jay lied."Jay," Hermione giving her brother a stern look "Didn\'t we taught the children not to lie towards others that includes the adults," she explained.Jay sighed at this "I did\xe2\x80\xa6 but, that doesn\'t mean I want my sisters to meddle into my love life Mya I\'m fine being single it\'s less of a hassle that way plus I don\'t want to confuse my kids ya know""I\'m not meddling I\'m just a being concern sister," Hermione began to say giving him a playfully shrug "And it\'s okay if you do I just want you to be happy" she explained.Jay soften his eyes "Thanks nugget I appreciate that and I also want you to be happy trust me I\'m fine being single," he began to say as Hermione nodded at this "So you ready to go?" he explained."I know you do and yes, I\'m ready to go when you are," Hermione explained throwing the trash and pushed the strollers with her kids with Teddy\'s help as they headed inside.Jay and Hermione both showed their tickets as they\'re a few people who got inside first with a pack of kids who had their names under a logo of the zoo which was customize from Hermione as she gave it to them to wear for the day. The co-worker in the zoo greeted them with a smile and cooed over the kids being adorable which they both thanked them."Where do you want to go first?""Hmmm\xe2\x80\xa6." Hermione looked around for the map "Let\'s look at the map since it\'s been awhile since I been here,""Sure," Jay nodded at this "Come on kids stay close hmm?"Logan being the eldest of Jay\'s children "Hey dad is this the zoo that you, auntie Minnie and auntie Ariel used to go when you were our age?" he asked.Jay chuckled "It is it\'s not every day that we get to the zoo so I figured why not take you kids here since your aunt Hermione planned this day for us," he explained."Really?" Logan began to say turning to his godmother Hermione as her lips twitched "You planned this auntie Minnie?" he explained."I did so what do you think of the zoo so far?" Hermione asked.Logan scanned around with a shrug "It\'s alright I mean \xe2\x80\xa6 not that I have a problem with muggles or anything but, I never been to the zoo before?" he explained."There\'s a lot of places that we haven\'t been yet at least in England anyway," Jay pointed out causing them quiet "Besides\xe2\x80\xa6 your mum and I used to take you guys here as children," he explained."Really?" Zander looked surprised by this "I don\'t remember going to the zoo dad?" he asked.Jay chuckled "That\'s because you were only a few months old then that was probably the last time we ever took you guys to the zoo but, it was in America they had a lot animals there but, that\'s just my opinion really," he explained.Zander slowly nod at this "That would explain why I don\'t remember much since I was only a few month old," he murmured causing their sisters to giggle "What do they usually have in the zoo?" he explained."Zoo animals there\'s also a petting zoo where we can pet the zoo animals by the bears," Hermione pointed out."Really? We can pet them auntie Minnie?" Sophia asked with an awe look."Not the bears, tigers, lions or any endangered animals obviously the mama bear wouldn\'t like that probably the baby animals depending on the animals," Hermione pointed out."Oh\xe2\x80\xa6" Sophia pouted at this causing Jay to kiss his daughter on the forehead "Can we pet the giraffe daddy?""I\'m pretty sure we can we just have to be extra careful and keep close to us I don\'t want you guys to get lost in this zoo since it\'s a pretty big place okay," Jay explained."Sure dad," Logan and everyone nodded at this following their dad Jay and their aunt Hermione with their cousins."Look daddy there\'s a giraffe?" Hannah cried out looking at the cage where the giraffe\'s are."I can see that tigger," Jay nodded at this "Why don\'t you guys sit down the bus should be arriving soon,""Okay," Hanna asked holding Henry and Evie onto her lap, Aria was holding James and Seth while Hermione held Henry onto her lap, then there\'s CJ holding Rosie and Daisy then Sophy holding Amelia and Hugo onto their laps while Newt, Nelson, Aria and Hanna with Teddy sat down next to them between Jay and Hermione since it\'s a huge group."Daddy can we get something to eat after this?""Didn\'t you get eat breakfast this morning,""No... I didn\'t have time... daddy,"Jay sighed at this after to get up but, Hermione held him back "I packed a lunch for us to eat," she started grabbing her beaded bag grabbing the lunch boxes for the kids who looked at her with gawking look "What don\'t look at me like that so I tend to be prepare a lot of things but, here Hannah take your pick I packed a lot," she explained."Thank you, auntie Minnie,""Of course, Hanna bear,""Thanks Mia what will I do with you,""Probably forgetting the lunches for the kids," Hermione winked causing Jay to chuckle knowing she\'s right when the bus started to start their tour looking inside her beaded bag "I also packed myself lunch too," she explained eating her sandwich causing Jay to shake his head "Don\'t worry I got your something too Jay,""Brilliant because I\'m starving," Jay sighed eating his sandwich "Oh look the bus is coming and they\'re gathering the line we should head over there now if we want to get a good seats," he explained."I was just thinking the same thing\xe2\x80\xa6" Hermione winked as she gathered the kids in a line as they went inside "I don\'t remember seeing this many animals," she murmured."It\'s an everyday life nugget and oh look there\'s Panda\'s bears I bet Lily and the girls would like that," Jay pointed out.Hermione nodded at this "Oh yes, they love panda\'s and any bears they have here along with myself," she explained."There\'s also\xe2\x80\xa6 monkey\'s,""Monkey\'s?""Yes, go look their over there Aria,""Their so small \xe2\x80\xa6 auntine Minnie,""Yes, there\'s all sorts of animals here including the monkeys in different sizes,""Really like what?""Gorilla\'s, monkey\'s, all sorts of them," Hermione sighed at this taking her camera out "And let\'s not forget to take pictures to capture the moment huh?" she explained causing Jay to chuckle, once they were done they went to look the next destination on the map.Jay suggested to take the tour first since they had a long day ahead of them which she agreed. They went to the line which wasn\'t long it was quite short as they\'re in the front of the line Jay helped Hermione take the quints\xe2\x80\x94James, Seth, Lily, Evie and Henry by holding their hands since the stroller wasn\'t allowed on the tour bus and put the stroller inside her beaded bag for safe keeping while Teddy helped out whenever he could; Jay however being the father of teenagers of 14 years old soon being the eldest would carry the quints James, Seth, Lily, Evie and Henry then, Rose, Daisy, Amelia and Hugo onto their laps since it was hard to see the animals in close up then Nelson and Newton would squeal seeing the eagles based on Ravenclaw of their house in Hogwarts\xe2\x80\x94then Aria and Hannah would sit in their adopted daddy who happens to be their uncle\'s Jay lap while taking pictures of each animal of the event on what\'s going to happen.During the tour which was an hour ride to drive around the zoo in each spot of each animals- James, Seth, Lily, Evie, Henry, Rose, Daisy, Amelia, Hugo, Teddy, Logan Zander, CJ, Sophia, Newton, Nelson, Aria and Hanna were in awe seeing each animal; Lily, Evie, Rose, Daisy, Amelia and Sophia especially love the Panda Bears which was a long line but, Hermione muttered under her breath to speed up the line a bit so they can see them within 1 minute.Once they took tons of pictures of the Panda\'s, Giraffe\'s, tigers, monkey\'s, lions, wolves which Teddy and the boys loved a lot then there\'s the reptiles which Hermione shivered seeing the snakes as she\'s not a big fan of them not because it\'s based on the Slytherin house but, it just reminded her of bad memories of the wizarding war in England fighting for their lives against Voldemort because of it."Wow look auntie Minnie it\'s the tiger," Hanna exclaimed.Hermione giggled "Yes Hanna bear that\'s a snow tiger apparently it blends in with the snow," she murmured."Snow?" Arianna asked."Yes, snow tigers usually can blend through the colors of snow because of their fur look," Hermione murmured.Arianna stared at the tiger in awe "It\'s so pretty I want a tiger daddy," she declared."You want a snow tiger huh?" Jay chuckled kissing his baby girl "We\'ll see how it goes baby girl,"Arianna pouted and watched the tiger for another five minutes and went to the next stop which was the Giraffes, Hippos etc "I still want one daddy," she muttered under her breath."If we find a pet shop in Diagon Alley we\'ll get you one okay," Jay promised his daughter causing Aria to perk up."Really daddy oh that would be really brilliant," Arianna perked up."Anything for you baby girl in fact I\'m planning on getting you guys a pet when we reached to America in Friday,""Really dad? That would really brilliant what kind of animal can we get?" CJ asked."Anything really? We have a huge property when we get back home in America so we can set a mini farm for our pets if you want?" Jay asked."How big is it daddy?" Hannah asked."I would say\xe2\x80\xa6 550,000 acres wide and long it\'s pretty big," Jay rubbed his chin deep in thought causing his kids to widen their eyes in awe "And we\'re even thinking of making a Quidditch field for you guys,""No way you\'re going to make a-" Logan was muffled causing Hermione his godmother and auntie a stern who dragged him away from Jay and the kids who were looking around the birds not to far away from their and put a silent charm "What was that for?" he explained."Hey where you guys going?" Jay asked."Logan and I are going to check out the birds here we\'ll be catch up in a bit," Hermione told him."Alright but, we should also check out the other animals too so don\'t take too long,""Will do," Hermione began to say then gave a stern look towards Logan who bowed his head "Logan Matthew Granger what did I tell you not to mention anything in front of muggles," she explained."Not to reveal anything magical or do magic in public," Logan mumbled under his breath shifting a bit uncomfortable not liking to disappoint his godmother and aunt."Good and yes we\'re going to build one but, we can\'t say that out loud especially in a crowded place you know that," Hermione murmured with a soft look."Sorry auntie Minnie," Logan bowed his head in shame "I didn\'t mean too\xe2\x80\xa6 I was just excited\xe2\x80\xa6""I know you are and are you going to keep quiet as a secret until we\'re by ourselves,"Logan nodded at this eaglery with a puppy dog look causing Hermione to sigh as they sat down on the bench "Logan I know you\'re excited but, you can\'t reveal much. I don\'t want you to get hurt over this okay. I\'m only doing this because I love you," she whispered."I know," Logan bowed his head sitting down next to his aunt "I\'m sorry auntie Minnie \xe2\x80\xa6 I just\xe2\x80\xa6 I didn\'t know we can build one in America?" he explained.Hermione sighed at this holding her godson and nephew into a hug "From what I can tell in America there\'s a lot of magical schools all over the world including the ones that we\'re moving too and I\'m pretty sure they have one too I just thought we should build one at our place since it\'s a big a property but, you can\'t tell anyone except the ones within our family or your friends that you\'ll make in school okay promise me," she explained."I promise," Logan nodded at this as he gave her a hug which Hermione returned the gesture "And I love you too auntie Minnie thank you for being there for me and everyone else\xe2\x80\xa6 you\'re the best godmother a guy has ever asked for especially after what happen to mum," he whispered.Hermione soften her eyes "And I love you and you\'re an awesome godson and nephew an aunt ever ask for now come on your dad along with everyone else is probably where we are. I\'m always here for you guys no matter how busy I look never forget okay" she explained.Logan nodded at this "Okay\xe2\x80\xa6and I won\'t" he began to say pausing for a moment "Hey auntie Minnie?" he asked."Yeah?""How come we have to move all the way to America?"Hermione sighed at this "We just thought that we can start fresh to a new place that happens to be in America. We all need it especially your father and I," she explained.Logan grew quiet "Does it have to be in America?" he murmured."It does," Hermione nodded at this "Do you remember how we were in war in England a few years ago,""Barley\xe2\x80\xa6 I was only a few months old from what dad told me right?""Yes you were\xe2\x80\xa6that\'s why we wanted to get away from the bad memories from the war, the horrors that we can\'t seem to move on\xe2\x80\xa6 and mostly\xe2\x80\xa6 from the press they were being quite restless since your uncle Harry, uncle Ron and I won the war so we can be in peace against a very bad guy do you remember that your dad told you about it,""He did\xe2\x80\xa6 he said that we were living in America that time right?""You were...you stayed there until you were 7 years old maybe more but, your parents wanted to make sure before they move back to England that it was less dangerous than before,""Wouldn\'t it be dangerous anyway to wherever we live auntie Minnie,""Probably but, in our situation your parents wanted to make sure that you kids won\'t go through what we went through which is why we\'re moving back to America so you guys can have a normal life besides being a wizard and a witch Logan,""Oh\xe2\x80\xa6 so I was born in America then?""Yes, in Forks, Washington since it\'s your father\'s, your aunt Ariel\'s and my home town, we even gave you a baptism when you were a few months old-you were still in your mum\'s tummy then when I send you guys away from the war so you guys wouldn\'t get hurt so technically you were born in Forks just like we were,""So I was born there\xe2\x80\xa6 in America then how did we end up being here in England?""Your parents waited until the coast was clear for them to move back to England after we won the war since it was still dangerous then,""Oh\xe2\x80\xa6 is that what you did auntie Minnie to send gramps and nana away to protect them like you did with my dad and auntie Ariel,""I did it was probably \xe2\x80\xa6 one of the hardest decisions I had to do but, I don\'t regret it because I didn\'t want you guys to get hurt from the death eaters and I didn\'t want to lose you guys,"Logan grew quiet nodding at this "I\'m glad you did too auntie Minnie because then I wouldn\'t be able to \xe2\x80\xa6 grow up in a safe place so thank you for protecting us away from the war," he whispered.Hermione soften her eyes giving him a hug "Your very welcome," she wiped her tears quickly "Now come on your dad and our family are probably wondering what\'s taking us so long huh since we were supposed to take pictures of these birds?" she explained causing Logan to nod at this after taking a quick picture of the bird with a smile then rushed over to Jay and the kids."Hey everything okay?" Jay asked noticing that Logan and Hermione got back from their talk."Yeah everything\'s fine dad," Logan nodded at this as he gave a smile "Auntie Minnie and I were just looking at the birds over there," he explained."Oh," Jay nodded at this as he gave a raise eyebrow at Hermione who mouth \'I\'ll tell you later,\' then gave a shrug knowing his sister will tell him what\'s up "Well we\'re about to head back to the bus since they\'re waiting for us," he explained."Okay dad," Logan replied as they raced over to the bus as they went to the second part of the zoo to look at the rest of the animals and finally done with their tour as the last stop was by the hippos, elphanants, and zebra\'s."Oh, look daddy it\'s the hippo," Sophia cried out then furrowed her eyes "Daddy what are they doing?"Jay stared at the hippos in horror covering the kids eyes while Hermione did the same as they\'re too young to witness that "Their uh wrestling\xe2\x80\xa6" he lied."Wrestling that\'s a bit weird dad?" Zander furrowed his eyebrows at this "Are you sure they\'re \xe2\x80\xa6wrestling\xe2\x80\xa6 that looks a bit painful if they\'re wrestling," he explained.\'Oh my Merlin\xe2\x80\xa6 leave it to the hippos to be in mating season,\' Hermione thought to herself shaking her head.Hermione gave a weak smile "Let\'s just \xe2\x80\xa6 look at the other animals huh?" she offered causing Jay to sigh in relief; leave it to the hippos to do their mating season bit today of all days and found a restaurants across the animals after taking a bit of a break looking at the animals."Auntie Minnie can we buy this cake," Hanna asked staring at the cake in awe.Hermione lips twitched "Sure tigger, what kind of cake do you want? Only a small cake since we don\'t want to ruin your lunch huh?"Hanna nodded at this "Um\xe2\x80\x94" she looked around the selections staring at the Oreo cookies \'n cr\xc3\xa8me chocolate cake "That one auntie Minnie we can make a wish for uncle Harry," she murmured.Hermione felt her eyes tears up which Jay gave his sister a hand squeeze "I bet he would\'ve really loved that tigger," she whispered after picking the small cake with one candle that was enough for everyone after singing \'Happy Birthday\' to their uncle despite how he wasn\'t with them putting a silent charm being away from the crowd "Make a wish Harry\xe2\x80\xa6" she whispered and blew the candles."That was beautiful," Jay murmured kissing his sister Hermione on the forehead taking a picture for their scrapbook "Happy birthday Harry," lifting his cup for his brother-in-law "We miss you buddy along with the rest of the Weasley\'s I bet you\'re really loving it up there," he murmured not realizing that his late brother in-law Harry was watching from afar."I miss you too Jay\xe2\x80\xa6 "Harry murmured noticing his kids and Teddy turning to him with wide eyes giving a mouth message \'Thanks for the cake and the present pup we\'ll see each other soon don\'t tell your godmother\' to keep quiet in hush, hush and left that Teddy had to shake his head probably hallucinating."Teddy you okay?" Logan asked.Teddy turned to the same spot where he could\'ve sworn he saw his godfather Harry from the tree not far from them telling him to keep a secret but, it couldn\'t be \xe2\x80\xa6 could it\xe2\x80\xa6since \xe2\x80\xa6 he\'s\xe2\x80\x94then shook his head looking at Logan his cousin.\'Nah\xe2\x80\xa6 couldn\'t be there\'s no way-\' Teddy began to say pausing for a moment \'Although\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s not the first time I saw him... maybe I can ask dad\xe2\x80\xa6he should know\xe2\x80\xa6\' he thought to himself."Teddy?" Logan shook his cousin to snap him out of it "Anyone there?" he asked,"Yeah\xe2\x80\xa6 yeah I\'m fine let\'s have some cake huh?" Teddy murmured probably seeing things as he must\'ve tired then he realize.Logan stared at his cousin with a puzzle look then shrugged it off "Sure," he murmured looking at the spot that Teddy looked only to find it was empty causing him quite puzzled on who Teddy was looking at since there was nothing there.After a few hours they saw most of animals in the zoo until they looked at their watches stated it was now 12:30 they have about 5 \xc2\xbd hours left before the zoo closes at six where Hermione suggested they take them to the park and buy ice cream which isn\'t far from the zoo and then take them to the toy store which Jay happily agreed stating that it was their day causing the kids to squeal happily.Once they were done seeing the animals Jay suggested they get something to eat since they have some time before the park closes which she agreed since she\'s hungry and she\'s sure the kids were hungry as well. They found a fast food restaurant near the Panda\'s and Jay ordered the food with the drinks to go with it\xe2\x80\x94the gift shop had Panda\'s, Polar Bears, Grizzly Bears, with mixed animals of tigers, wolves, giraffe\'s etc.By the time they went inside they looked around with an awe look on their faces looking at their mother Hermione who knew once you see a store full of toys they\'ll be bound to buy more knowing her children since they tend to buy a lot of toys."Go on lovelies it\'s your day," Hermione announced.The kids dragged their mum inside causing her to chuckle knowing the kids wanted another toy; this time it was all about Panda\'s so you can see Lily, Evie, Rose, Daisy, Amelia, Sophia, Hanna and Aria were in awe\xe2\x80\x94they looked at their mum and auntie with a puppy look showing their father\'s green eyes, Ron\'s eyes and Sophia\'s eyes; how can Hermione say no to the girls which reminded her of her husband Harry whenever he looked at her like that; she sighed since she\'s not stingy on money but, she wanted her babies to have a memorable fun day so that\'s what she did and took every picture whenever they grabbed a new animal."Momma Minnie can we get this one please?" Rose asked."You want \xe2\x80\xa6 an orange bear huh?" Hermione asked raising her eyebrow at her goddaughter Rose who flushed at this with a shy smile."Yes, I want this\xe2\x80\xa6 you told me daddy was an orange bear, right?" Rose asked."He was\xe2\x80\xa6" Hermione sighed at this "Let me guess you want to name him after your father Ron, don\'t you?" she murmured.Rose nodded at this "Yes can I momma Minnie?" she asked."Of course, luv," Hermione murmured."Momma!?" Henry cried out causing Hermione to turn to her youngest son who tugged her coat "Look, look it\'s grandpa Prongs," he asked.Hermione blinked her eyes owlish looking at the stag that was exactly like her husband and her father-in-law James Potter Animagus \'Prongs\' which was odd since she didn\'t really remember seeing this from the store."Henry sweetie where did you get this?" Hermione murmured.Henry titled his head "I got that from over there mama," he murmured pointing at the deer, stags, dogs, wolves etc in the other side of the shelves filled with other animals "Uncle Jay helped me find him,"Hermione nodded at this "Of course do you want to buy this Henry?" she asked.Henry nodded at this "Yes, mummy I would love that very much it\'s like daddy and grandpa Prongs," he announced.Hermione chuckled kissing her youngest son Henry "Well of course it\'s like your father and your grandfather I bet your grandpa Remus would tell you bunch of stories when he was a student with your grandfather\'s back then huh?" she explained.Henry nodded eagerly "Oh yes, pop-pop Remus is quite brilliant mama. I want to get a wolf, a dog and a stag by naming them after them, so can I?" he explained."Put it in the cart," Hermione murmured causing Henry to perk up putting the three stuff animals inside the cart while the rest of her children would add more toys inside the cart among other toys.She bought most of the stuff animals in every store leaving the co-workers who worked there to stare at her in awe; Hermione even donated at least $10,000 muggle money for the Panda\'s and the rest of the endangered animals to help who thanked her each time whenever she donated money for each animal to help.Hermione put all the toys inside her beaded bag seeing it was a lot of toys thanks to her kids but, she didn\'t mind if her kids are happy she is too. She felt a sudden stung in her heart that her husband, her best friend Harry couldn\'t be here to watch their kids like this\xe2\x80\x94she clutched her locket close as she tried to hold back her tears that she felt a hand on her shoulder that she couldn\'t help but, jump about to attack whoever touched her only to see it was her brother Jay who had a soft worried look."You okay nugget?" Jay murmured.Hermione smiled shook her head "Yeah just some memories\xe2\x80\xa6" she murmured and sighed "Thank you for coming with me big brother it meant a lot to me,"Jay smiled softly "You\'re welcome I\'m glad you had fun," he began to say then looked at his watch that Mal gave him, he never took it off and whenever it\'s low batteries he would get a new battery in his digital camera as they still have some time before they leave as it was barely 2:30 in the afternoon "Since we saw most of the animals why don\'t we head to the park after we\'re done eating then go shopping at the mall and get that ice cream that we promised, buy toys and new clothes since we\'re leaving in Friday early in the morning they need muggle clothes before it gets dark and head home later," he explained.Hermione nodded at this "Oh yes, they really need new clothes especially the muggle clothes\xe2\x80\xa6 then we need to make a list on what we should build in our property," she explained."Besides building a Quidditch field, new houses and a mini mall?" Jay asked."Yes, exactly,""How about \xe2\x80\xa6 we make a sports center like with each sports we can play soccer, basketball, tennis court, baseball field etc? So that way the kids can play other sports besides Quidditch?"Hermione smiled "That\'s actually brilliant Jay and we can also build a farm for our animals,""Like pigs, cows, horses, chickens, sheep, geese etc?""Well I wouldn\'t go that far with geese but, I suppose we could\xe2\x80\xa6 and don\'t forget cats, dogs, and magical pets too,""Yeah we couldn\'t forget that especially since we promised to go to the magical pet shop for the kids when we go to Forks,""We did promise them didn\'t we?""We did,""Then we should start planning ahead of time I\'ll let Aqua and Ruby know and they\'ll send Yuki to set it up,""Sounds like a plan nugget,"Hermione grabbed her children putting them in the stroller along while holding Teddy\'s hand along with Jay\'s kids by telling them it was time to leave the zoo since they already saw all the animals heading to the park first to have a picnic since they had a lot to plan with lots of goodies, toys to play with and pictures of each event leaving early and left the zoo. They left the zoo around 2:45 in the afternoon since the zoo closes at 6:00 p.m. since they saw all the animals and every show of the event.Jay and Hermione set up a picnic for themselves while the kids play in the playground. Their children were happy gleeful when they arrived at the park while Hermione and Jay catch up with everything. After a long day Hermione called the kids over, so they can eat they ran to their godmother, mother and auntie and sat down to eat chatting about their day telling Hermione and Jay what was their favorite animal that Hermione took another picture of the kids by making a mental note to print them out later to add them in the scrapbook to create more memories."So, what was your favorite part in the zoo Mia?" Jay asked as the kids were playing in the playground."I think I would have to say was\xe2\x80\xa6 the panda bears despite how they didn\'t much they were just so cute to look at," Hermione murmured looking at her pictures through her digital camera."Oh, look there\'s Teddy making funny faces with Logan and the boys," Jay chuckled "That was funny,""Oh yes look at Rosie and Daisy they\'re putting necklaces and making a pose," Hermione chuckled at this "With Lily, Amelia and Evie smiling at the grizzly bears," she explained.Jay chuckled "It would see the kids have fun that\'s good I would hate for them to \xe2\x80\xa6 be sad during the week before we leave," he explained.Hermione nodded at this "Yeah\xe2\x80\xa6 speaking of\xe2\x80\xa6 visiting\xe2\x80\xa6 graves\xe2\x80\xa6 "she began to say putting a silent charm not wanting the kids to get worried "Evie \xe2\x80\xa6 told me something\xe2\x80\xa6 this morning," she murmured."Oh? What did she say?" Jay asked turning to his sister."She said\xe2\x80\xa6 she saw a man\xe2\x80\xa6 that looked like Harry," Hermione murmured looking at the kids in the corner of her eye then turned to her brother."That\'s \xe2\x80\xa6 impossible\xe2\x80\xa6 isn\'t it\xe2\x80\xa6 since he\'s\xe2\x80\x94" Jay was cut off by Hermione at this."Dead\xe2\x80\xa6I know\xe2\x80\xa6you don\'t think\xe2\x80\xa6 he\'d\xe2\x80\x94" Hermione bowed her head at this "I know it\'s impossible\xe2\x80\xa6but, we never did find his body," she murmured."You mean we buried an empty casket?" Jay asked.Hermione sighed at this "No it\'s not that there\'s\xe2\x80\xa6 a dead body inside Harry\'s casket\xe2\x80\xa6 but, when I looked at it this morning\xe2\x80\xa6it didn\'t look like Harry," she murmured."Then who did we just bury then if it\'s not Harry?" Jay asked."I have no idea\xe2\x80\xa6" Hermione murmured.Jay grew quiet and felt a sudden cold chill down his spine "Who in the right mind would\xe2\x80\x94" he stopped to realize this might upset his sister and rapidly changed the subject "Well\xe2\x80\xa6what are you going to do? Does the kids know?" he explained."No \xe2\x80\xa6 I wasn\'t going to \xe2\x80\xa6 traumatized my children over this\xe2\x80\xa6 I decided to keep it to myself," Hermione explained.~*~End of Chapter Ten~*~Wow I didn\'t realize it was really late\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s now \xe2\x80\xa6 2:50 in the morning\xe2\x80\xa6 I should head to bed and will be updating again tomorrow despite how I\'ll be a bit busy this weekend but, I\'ll be updating when I get a chance, so you\'ll be seeing a lot of updates this month and hope you guys have a good weekend.

Ciao for now dolls ^_^ Chapter Eleven: ZSL London Zoo (Part 2)Jay grew quiet staring at his sister "Does Draco and the others know about this?" he murmured."At first I wanted to keep it quiet but, then I knew deep down that they\'re going to find out either way so I told Draco about it and he told me that they\'ll be looking into it and will let me know what\'s going on?""So what do you think it was\xe2\x80\xa6 that made Evie thought it was Harry\xe2\x80\xa6" Jay whispered."I have no idea\xe2\x80\xa6 since she wasn\'t there when he died\xe2\x80\xa6 or the Weasley\'s since they were watched over with Remus, Tonks and Andromeda at the manor\xe2\x80\xa6 so how can she know\xe2\x80\xa6" Hermione began to say causing Jay quiet then gave a sigh "I don\'t know anymore\xe2\x80\xa6 all I know is that\xe2\x80\xa6 when the Weasley\'s bodies are in ash\xe2\x80\xa6 cremated since they were burned alive in the Burrow\xe2\x80\xa6 I figured we can bring them with us besides Harry, Sirius and his parents\xe2\x80\xa6 to be near mum and daddy\xe2\x80\xa6 along with \xe2\x80\xa6 Mal and Sophy\xe2\x80\xa6 does that make me selfish to bring them along," she explained."No it doesn\'t make you selfish at all but, transferring everyone burials all the Forks," Jay gawked at his sister for a moment "As for Evie\xe2\x80\xa6 I think Evie\'s magic is growing that she can see\xe2\x80\xa6 spirits maybe\xe2\x80\xa6 I\'m not entirely sure but, for her being your daughter between you and Harry I wouldn\'t be surprised," he explained.Hermione grew quiet "I\'m scared Jay\xe2\x80\xa6 what if \xe2\x80\xa6 someone is pretending to be Harry\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s going to confuse the kids\xe2\x80\xa6" she whispered.Jay soften his eyes rush to give her a hug "Baby girl\xe2\x80\xa6 I don\'t know what to think to be honest and we just have to be the best parent the kid could have," he whispered."I suppose your right\xe2\x80\xa6 and it would be more easier for the kids and for us to visit them occasionally instead of being so far away\xe2\x80\xa6 I want them to be close to us," Hermione drifted off as she felt herself teared up "A-are you angry?" she whispered."You want us to transfer everyone\'s burials all the way to Forks?" Jay asked gawked at this.Jay grew quiet "I can never be mad at you nugget but, I never \xe2\x80\xa6 transferred a dead body before\xe2\x80\xa6 despite that\'s my late wife Mal\xe2\x80\xa6 and my sister in-law Sophy\xe2\x80\xa6 do you think it\'s possible to do that\xe2\x80\xa6 since I do want to visit them every day\xe2\x80\xa6 it would give me some peace knowing I don\'t have to worry about them...I don\'t want them to be in the wrong hands\xe2\x80\xa6" he whispered."Yeah, it\'s possible\xe2\x80\xa6I made sure to use powerful wards around the place since mum and daddy are buried in Forks since mum was born there as a child and I also think that it would give the kids ease over the whole thing and no one will ruin that not even them I\'ll make sure of it," Hermione whispered."Yeah she was\xe2\x80\xa6 along with dad\xe2\x80\xa6 since he grew up in Forks for a little while\xe2\x80\xa6" Jay murmured "How long will it take do you know?""Aqua told me it\'s usually take under a month usually but, Draco knows people and getting help as much as he can thanks to his parents they offered to help and I thought you said that Aqua and Ruby are taking care of it this morning?" Hermione explained."Just Harry, his parents and Sirius I didn\'t realize you meant everyone\xe2\x80\xa6 it would\'ve made things much easier\xe2\x80\xa6 and I also \xe2\x80\xa6 had confirmed that Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy are offering to help after what they did to you you\xe2\x80\xa6" Jay murmured."It wasn\'t their fault Jay\xe2\x80\xa6 it was \xe2\x80\xa6" Hermione murmured."I know it wasn\'t\xe2\x80\xa6 but, considering the situation I don\'t know how I feel about that\xe2\x80\xa6 " Jay drifted off staring at his children who was chatting away with Teddy and the kids "But, then again I would feel more ease if my wife and sister-in-law\'s burial was close to us\xe2\x80\xa6 so you have my permission to move them?" he murmured."Are you sure? Because we\'re not going to come back to England\xe2\x80\xa6 unless it was really necessary\xe2\x80\xa6" Hermione murmured."Yeah\xe2\x80\xa6 I\'m sure\xe2\x80\xa6 just\xe2\x80\xa6 promise me that when you do\xe2\x80\xa6 to call me so I can make the arrangements," Jay pointed out."I promise since we\'re transferring them tomorrow before we head to the carnival and we\'ll be be gone by then,""Good\xe2\x80\xa6" Jay drifted off after taking off the silent charm "I just hope you know what you\'re doing Mia?""Me too\xe2\x80\xa6. But, it would give us an ease of peace don\'t you think and I don\'t want anyone to be near them since it\'s not anyone\'s business to go there. No one knows where they were buried except us,""Then we don\'t have a problem as long as the press doesn\'t know about the location,""They don\'t I made sure of it since it\'s completely protected,""And that\'s good because if it goes to the wrong hands...they could \xe2\x80\xa6 make any \xe2\x80\xa6 unnecessary dark magic to do so to bring them back from the dead right,""No one isn\'t going use any dark magic over my late husband or my family Jay trust me I made sure of it,""Good\xe2\x80\xa6"By the time it reached 3:30 in the afternoon Hermione and Jay both decided to take the kids to the mall only because they promised they would despite how they have enough toys that it brought their children squealing happily because of it not that Hermione or Jay minds but, it was for her kids\xe2\x80\x94celebrating their father Harry\'s birthday it was a good day to spend some quality time together since she wants her kids to be happy and would take lots of pictures to capture the moment.There were a lot with Hermione posing with the children but, it was totally worth it loads of smiles for today she just wished her husband Harry was witnessing this as well along with Ron and Susan who would\'ve gained more children if they wanted too."So, which side of the mall should we go Mya?" Jay asked."I\'m not sure\xe2\x80\xa6" Hermione drifted off looking around the mall "I suppose we can go to the left side of the mall and you get the right what do you think?" she explained."That sounds good why don\'t we split up I\'ll take the boys while you take the girls?" Jay offered."Brilliant," Hermione murmured "Do you have your cell phone, wand, and two-sided mirror with your money?""Yeah, I got everything, my wand, my cell phone, beeper, IPad Air 2, two-sided mirror and my wallet full of money," Jay murmured about to check his wallet when his eldest son Logan interrupting him."Hey dad can Zayne, CJ and I check out the Game Stop over there," Logan asked.Jay raised his eyebrow at his eldest son with a sigh "Yeah of course son, here\'s some cash in case you want to get some video games since our flight in Friday is 11 hours long, so you might as well occupy yourself for the time being," he explained giving him muggle money $100 each.Logan widen his eyes in awe "Really dad sweet! Come on guys let\'s head over there," he hollered at his brothers who nodded eagerly."Logan sweetheart," Hermione called after her nephew."Yes, auntie Minnie?" Logan asked."Do you mind watching over Teddy, James, Seth, Henry, and Hugo while you\'re at it since I\'ll be taking the girls shopping please and your father will be accompanying you since you\'re not familiar to muggle London yet since we\'re splitting up I\'m going to the left while you and the boys with your father Jay will go to the right side of the mall," Hermione offered.Logan face fell but, beamed at this "Okay I\'ll be sure to watch over my little cousins""Thank you and, do you have everything and Logan?"Logan nodded at this "Yeah I got everything with me it\'s inside my jacket and yes auntie Minnie?""Good, keep it with you at all times and don\'t get into mischief trouble or even try to give out any pranks against anyone please,""Of course, auntie Minnie we\'ll be good," Zander grinned showing his innocent face.Jay chuckled as his sons reminded him when he was their age "Like I believe that," he muttered under his breath as he wrapped his son with his left arm ruffling his hair causing Zander to scowl "You remind me of your mother when you smile like that," he snorted at this."Dad!""Come on you knuckleheads let\'s see what kind of video games they have hmm?" Jay offered causing the boys to cheer at this."Momma," Lily whimpered "How come we can\'t go with them?""Luv they want to play video games but, don\'t worry Lily flower I got something else planned who wants to go shopping with me?" Hermione smirked causing the girls to perk up as they dragged Hermione to the other side of the mall "Jay we\'ll meet at the food court say 2 hours?" she called over."Sounds good see you in two hours Mya," Jay answered.Zander\'s P.O.V.My three sisters and my cousins were shopping with our aunt Hermione which seemed to make our aunt happy; ever since our uncle Harry got killed she hasn\'t been smiling much unless it was us but, Logan and I along with CJ and Sophy were worried sick over our godmother who happens to be our auntie while we were in GameStop there was a few benches in front of the store so I just sat down."Hey Zayne, you okay?" my dad asked with a raise eyebrow."Yeah dad I\'m fine\xe2\x80\xa6 "I drifted off watching our aunt Hermione leaving to the left side with the girls "Just wanted to check on auntie Minnie with the girls since you can never know\xe2\x80\xa6 there are some creeps out there," he murmured.Jay followed where I was staring at as he gave a nod at this "Logan why don\'t you and the boys look around and stay close together while I talk to your brother huh?" Dad offered.Logan looked at me with a raise eyebrow then our dad with a slow nod at this "Yeah \xe2\x80\xa6 okay dad," as he held hands with James, Seth, Henry, and Hugo being our youngest cousins along with CJ, Newton and Nelson inside Game Stop while we sat down on the bench.Once they left us alone as we sat down on the bench "You mind telling me what was that about Zayne? You know you can talk to me about anything right?""I know I can I just\xe2\x80\xa6 I\'m worried about auntie Mia," I murmured."Oh, how come?" Dad asked curiously at this."Don\'t tell me you haven\'t noticed dad?" I asked."Noticed what exactly\xe2\x80\xa6?" dad asked I can tell he\'s a bit wary over this conversation."Auntie Mia never smiles that much anymore unless it was us," I pointed out.Dad sighed at this "I should\'ve known that you would\'ve noticed something off about your aunt," he puts his arm around me "Zayne kiddo, listen your aunt Hermione is just going through a rough time right now\xe2\x80\xa6 losing our uncle Harry broke her heart\xe2\x80\xa6 that left her as a widow to their children while losing their best friend your uncle Ron and his wife Susan along with the rest of the Weasley\'s, and the Thomas family who also got killed\xe2\x80\xa6" he began to say pausing for a moment "Do you remember when we learned that your uncle Ron, auntie Susan, the Weasley\'s family were killed being burned alive at the Burrow," he explained.I closed my eyes sadly "Of course ...they\'re like my best friends\xe2\x80\xa6 who would do something so horrible to burn them alive dad\xe2\x80\xa6 that\'s\xe2\x80\xa6 I can\'t even imagine how hard that was for uncle Charlie, uncle Fred and uncle George," I whispered."It was pretty horrible for us learning that our friends are dead\xe2\x80\xa6 being burned alive...along with those kids\xe2\x80\xa6" Their dad Jay began to say with a hoarse tones "I\'m just glad that \xe2\x80\xa6 Rose, Daisy, Amelia and Hugo were okay\xe2\x80\xa6 but, their cousins\xe2\x80\xa6 they\'re all dead...their whole family are dead\xe2\x80\xa6 the only uncles they have are just your uncle Charlie, uncle Fred, and uncle George with your auntie Ariel with their kids\xe2\x80\xa6 along with us and your auntie Hermione with her kids\xe2\x80\xa6 as for your uncle Ron and aunt Susan\xe2\x80\xa6 they got killed in St. Mungo\'s \xe2\x80\xa6 leaving their children orphans..that your aunt Hermione immediately adopted them into her family not wanting them to be in the orphanage who knows what could\'ve happen if someone took them\xe2\x80\xa6 your aunt Hermione wouldn\'t be able to forgive herself,"I grew quiet "I know\xe2\x80\xa6 I miss uncle Harry, uncle Ron, auntie Susan and everyone else too\xe2\x80\xa6including mum and auntie Sophy" I whispered."We all do kiddo but, not as much as your aunt Hermione though," Dad pointed out."Because auntie Minnie married uncle Harry and gained the quints dad?" I asked.Jay chuckled "Something like that but, mostly it\'s because\xe2\x80\xa6 their best friends they consider themselves as family so it\'s hard to lose someone you love is all\xe2\x80\xa6it\'s something that everyone can move on from that," he explained."Like we did when we lost mom thanks to those death eaters dad?"Jay grew quiet with a tired sigh "Yeah\xe2\x80\xa6 It\'s like that son\xe2\x80\xa6 and it\'s a good thing your aunt Hermione and I killed those bastards\xe2\x80\xa6 but, it didn\'t bring them back\xe2\x80\xa6 at least now I can be at ease that those murders won\'t be able to come back \xe2\x80\xa6 we made sure of it..,and I hope you guys won\'t have to go through what we went through in a young age\xe2\x80\xa6" he explained."And I hope I don\'t either\xe2\x80\xa6 but, I really do miss mom\xe2\x80\xa6 I miss her very much," I whispered."I miss her too more than you ever know. I miss her everyday kiddo,""Then why do we have to move\xe2\x80\xa6 I don\'t want to move\xe2\x80\xa6 I have friends in Hogwarts dad?""You can make new friends in Forks too since you guys grew up in Forks for a little while? Don\'t you remember you used to go fishing with your uncle grandpa Charlie,""We have an uncle grandpa Charlie," I gave a blank look "How many grandpas do we have?"Dad laughed out loud "Yes, Zayne he\'s more like my uncle but, he\'s your uncle grandpa from mine, your auntie Hermione\'s and auntie Ariel\'s side of the family through your grandmother Emma being her older brother," he shrugged "He has a daughter\xe2\x80\xa6from his 2nd marriage \xe2\x80\xa6 Renee \xe2\x80\xa6 they have one daughter but, they got divorced\xe2\x80\x94so Isabella doesn\'t really know about us having magic and as for Isabella how can I say this without being rude\xe2\x80\xa6" he drifted off "She\'s \xe2\x80\xa6 not very nice\xe2\x80\xa6 so I want you and the kids to stay far away from her do you hear me," he explained."How come?" I asked curiously."Because Isabella isn\'t someone we get along with she\'s your aunt but, I don\'t think she\'ll like it if either of you kids call her aunt since she\'s never fond of kids as far as I know of any way\xe2\x80\xa6 your aunt Ariel, your aunt Hermione and I don\'t get along with her \xe2\x80\xa6 she was always jealous on how close we were with your uncle grandpa Charlie it would drive her mad\xe2\x80\xa6 but, it put a strain on her relationship with your uncle grandpa Charlie though because she always made him sad," Dad explained."Why would she make uncle grandpa Charlie sad dad?" I asked.Dad sighed at this "It\'s complicated but, let me just say this\xe2\x80\xa6 just stay away from her and her boyfriend Edward you hear me. I don\'t want you, Logan, CJ, Newton, Nelson and especially Teddy to not start any trouble or pranks. I mean you could on occasionally but, I just don\'t want you kids to get hurt especially your sisters and your cousins promise me Zander,"I grew quiet pondering what he said and gave him a hug "I promise dad. I won\'t go near him or Isabella as long as they stay away from us we\'ll all good," I smirked."Good, now come on let\'s get inside before your brothers, cousins and Teddy start making a pile of video games for us to do during the flight," Dad explained.I shrugged knowing Logan "Okay dad,"Jay and his son Zander went inside GameStop where they see Logan, CJ, Newton, Nelson, Henry, Seth, James, Hugo, and Teddy looking around the games section."Hey dad can we get this please," Newton asked showing their dad the video game."What\'s this about?" Dad asked.Newton shrugged "I don\'t know \xe2\x80\xa6 I never really tried it before... but, it looks interesting and there\'s a sale\xe2\x80\x94buy three in each section and you get two free. Isn\'t that an awesome deal dad?" he pleaded at this "Please dad," he explained.Jay sighed "Let\'s see what else your brothers, your cousins and Teddy brought, and we\'ll see how good the deal is huh?" he explained."Okay," Newton nodded at this as they looked around the store where something caught Jay\'s eye "I\'ll keep looking if there\'s any other games I want to try out," he explained."Take your time Newt," Jay began to say as he stopped to see the clearance aisle "I don\'t believe it.." he was in disbelief looking at the design on this\xe2\x80\x94he recognized it from his late brother-in-law Harry\xe2\x80\xa6 he remembered when Harry wanted to design a video game and it actually on stock; they only have 10 copies "I wonder\xe2\x80\xa6" he looked at the back which wasn\'t a bad deal and grabbed the whole thing "I have to show this to Mya\xe2\x80\xa6 excuse me ma \'me do you work here," he called over the co-worker who nodded at this "How much is this?" he asked."Yes, I do and ah that\'s from the clearance sale it\'s quite popular from our customers\xe2\x80\x94if you buy the whole set you\'ll get this free Nintendo DSL and a video game of your pick for free?" the co-worker Amy replied."Really\xe2\x80\xa6all of this and you get a free Nintendo DSL or something like that?" Jay asked."Yes sir," Amy nodded at this "Do you want to buy one?"Jay grinned "Yes I dot\xe2\x80\xa6 because I know the owner who made this\xe2\x80\xa6 I didn\'t think you still have this here," he explained."Really? You know who made this video game it\'s pretty impressive," Amy asked curiously."Yes\xe2\x80\xa6 it was my brother-in-law \xe2\x80\xa6 Harry he made this video game\xe2\x80\xa6it was quite popular where we\'re from\xe2\x80\xa6 in America\xe2\x80\xa6 but, um\xe2\x80\xa6" Jay began to say grab his credit card out of his wallet "How much for all of it? I want to get the whole set all ten of time\xe2\x80\xa6 and add a few video games to go with it?" he explained."You want to get all ten of these," Amy squeaked in shocked "All of it\xe2\x80\xa6""Yes, my sons, nephews and my godson are huge video games players so," Jay shrugged "And I guess they must\'ve inherit it from me," he grinned "They\'re over there,""Kids\xe2\x80\xa6" Amy squeaked then noticed that he had his wedding ring "Oh\xe2\x80\xa6 so you\'re married huh.."Jay gave a weird look "Yes happily married for 30 years," he explained giving a strain smile."Oh, that\'s so sweet," Amy giggle shyly which left Zander to give the lady an odd look at this as he reached to his dad to check out "I\'ll wrap this up for you in the check out when you ready," she explained."Perfect," Jay nodded at this ignoring the lady\'s flirting by focusing on his kids "Logan, kids are you guys ready to go because I\'m about to check out these?" he explained.Logan, Teddy, CJ, Newton, Nelson, James, Henry, Seth, and Hugo nodded at this adding their share of the video games, Nintendo DSL with controllers, batteries, covers, etc in one whole pile "This is what we want dad?" they answered."Is that everything sir?" Amy asked."Yes, that would be \xe2\x80\xa6 everything\xe2\x80\x94" Jay shakes his head knowing his sons and nephews while Amy went to check out their items from the store; apparently, they had about 10 video games each, so it was nearly $1,000 one thousand dollars "How much for everything?"Amy went to double check with everything "About $850.34 sir," she explained.Jay glowered at his sons for a moment who gave a sheepish grin "Sorry dad, sorry uncle Jay," they murmured."You boys are so damn lucky that today is our 2nd last day or else your aunt Hermione would hex my bloody arse knowing how much we spend all these video games," Jay began to grumble under his breath while Logan and the boys to grin "Don\'t grin it\'s not funny," he scolded the boys who bowed their heads in shame "We\'ll talk about this later\xe2\x80\xa6 here you go \xe2\x80\xa6" he explained paying the video games with his credit card.However, Amy swipes it, approve the credit card and put their video games inside the bag which is a lot and separated them in each pile not wanting to confuse them."Thank you sir," Amy began to say noticing how many sons he had "And we have a promotion for every customer who spend more than than $1,000 dollars you get a free video game being our 1,000 customer today so pick any video game you want boys," she explained."Really?" Nelson excitedly says, "Can we dad?""Why the hell not," Jay however, felt skeptically over the lady but, kept quiet not wanting to ruin their day as he grinned at his sons and nephews who went to grab their free video game putting it inside their backpacks "Thank you so much for the help," he explained."Of course, have a good day sir, and bye boys," Amy replied with a nod."Goodbye," Jay and the boys waved at Amy who returned the wave by helping them with the video games as they exit the store of Game Stop walking around the mall "So\xe2\x80\xa6 boys since we\'re done with our first story where do you want to go next since we have another hour and a half before we head home," he explained."Do you think they have an arcade dad?" Nelson asked."I\'m sure they do let\'s look at the map," Jay began to say looking at the map looking for the arcade "Let\'s me see\xe2\x80\xa6 it should be in the north west not far from here come on," he explained."Okay dad," Zander and the boys answered following suit "Oh look there is it,""I can see that," Jay told them."Hey dad what time are we going home?""Around 7:00 don\'t you remember we have a party to attend too,""Party what party?""You remember the surprise party that we\'re holding for your aunt it\'s our way for thanking her, your uncle Harry and uncle Ron for winning the war for us so we can in peace again,""Really? I thought you guys weren\'t having that anymore since the planned changed in the last minute dad,""Nope we\'re still having it we just haven\'t told your aunt Hermione since it\'s a surprise,""Oh yeah\xe2\x80\xa6 and for uncle Harry right since it\'s his birthday,""That\'s right,""Is that why we were meeting auntie Minnie today because of the party,""Yes and no \xe2\x80\xa6 one we\'re already meeting your aunt Hermione since we planned for this ahead of time and 2) they needed us to distract her for few hours while your aunt Ariel, uncle George, uncle Charlie, uncle Fred, uncle Draco, aunt Luna, uncle Blaise, uncle Neville, with your nana, your pops etc. set the party at 7 so we have\xe2\x80\xa6 4 \xc2\xbd hours until then I\'m sure we\'ll think of something until then can\'t we?" Jay explained."Yeah we can do that and look dad there\'s the arcade can you tell aunt Minnie and the girls to meet us here dad since it\'s in the middle of the mall," CJ explained."Yeah let me just text your aunt and we\'ll meet them there instead of the food court,"Sweet," Teddy and the boys exclaimed heading inside the arcade while Jay texted Hermione that instead of meeting at the food court they\'ll meet at the arcade that\'s by Hot Topic which didn\'t take very long for Hermione to reply telling him that sounds perfect since they\'re in Build-a-Bear so it\'s not far and that they\'ll see them soon.Jay grinned as he put their things inside his backpack since it had an undetectable extension charm inside thanks to Hermione\'s help which helped a lot since he always brings his backpack with him anyway. In the other side of the mall Hermione and the girls were wandering around until they went reached Forever 21 first."Come on girls let\'s go shopping," Hermione smirked causing the girls to squeal as they first went Forever 21 first then went to the Disney store "Let\'s go here first since you need new clothes," she explained."Auntie Minnie can we go here next?" Sophia announced."Where\'s that luv?" Hermione asked.Sophia squinted her eyes tilting her head "Um\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s called Build-a Bear? What\'s that auntie Minnie?"Hermione lips twitched "It\'s a toy store luv you pick a stuff animal, stuff it, give it a heart, and the co-worker would help you pick a name and adopt him by keeping him,"Sophia widen her eyes in awe "Can we go auntie Minnie I want another stuff animal?""And what kind of stuff animal do you want?" Hermione asked raising her eyebrow at her niece who happens to be goddaughter as well.Sophia pondered for a moment "I don\'t know\xe2\x80\xa6 can we look inside and see what they have auntie Minnie?""Of course, luv we have about two hours, so we can get as many toys as you want,""Really?""Yes including the new clothes that we need to buy for you, my daughters, brothers and my nephews along with your father,""Oh goodie," Sophia squealed as she grabbed her cousins and sisters hands "Come on auntie Minnie let\'s go,"Hermione chuckled as she was dragged from her daughters and her nieces heading to the Build-a Bear and the girls were in awe looking around turning to Hermione with their puppy dog doe look."Can we momma, can we?" Evie whimpered.Hermione sighed "You have already panda\'s, tigers, lions, snakes, wolves, and other animals from the zoo what could you possibly want as another animal?""A kitty cat,"Hermione gawked at her daughter "A kitty cat?""Yes, I want this one momma," Lily whimpered."Oh, you mean Hello Kitty of course you can get that,""Yeah can I have one too momma?" Evie pouted.Hermione sighed "Of course luv,""Really?""Yes, you can pick any animal you want and once you\'re done we get to talk to that lady and she\'ll help us okay,"Okay,"Evie, Lily, Rose, Daisy, Amelia, Sophia, Hanna and Arianna looked around, picking each animal\xe2\x80\x94Evie got another wolf, cat, a lion, and a bear, Lily got two wolves, a lion and a brown bear, then Rose got the same as Lily except her wolves were both brown, a golden lion and honey bear, Daisy got a puppy dog 4 of them, then a bird, lion and a bear, Hannah and Arianna both got the same but, different color\xe2\x80\x94Hannah got two bears, two dogs and wolves, the bears were white and black, the dogs were a Dalmatian dog and brown then the wolves were sandy wolf and red brownish wolf while Arianna\'s were two brown bears, two spots dogs of a Dalmatian and light brown wolf then Sophia hers was Hello Kitty characters\xe2\x80\x94Hello Kitty, Pochacco, and the penguin.It was a lot of animals but, they wanted it; Hermione made a mental note not to spoil her children too much but, she couldn\'t seem to say no to her children especially when they\'re like a mini version of her husband Harry and herself put together so how can she say no.Once they were done naming each other stuff animals and adopted them\xe2\x80\x94it was a lot of name; Evie named her wolf \'Sandy\' a girl, the cat \'Red\' boy, the lion \'Gryffindor007\' boy and a bear \'Honey\' is a girl which left Hermione lips to twitch, then her other daughter Lily got two wolves\xe2\x80\x94 \'Seth and Jake\', a lion Gryffindor07, and her bear was \'Papabear07\' filled with clothes. Rose named her wolves both boys \'Padfoot and Prongs\' and then the golden Lion \'Goldie\' which is a girl then the bear which is a girl \'Honeybear07\' with different outfits for each one.However, Daisy got a puppy\xe2\x80\x94Prongs07, Padfoot07, Mooney07 and Snowflake, then the lion is Leo, and the bear GrizzlyPotter07, Hannah two bears were boy and girl\xe2\x80\x94Hannah08 and Henry23, two dogs Pongo and Pansy, and Butch the wolf then Arianna\'s two bears\xe2\x80\x94Maliyah and Sophia that are girls, then Oreo and Snickers both boys, then Leah32, and finally Sophia\'s; Hello Kitty same character, Pochacoco \'Coco\' and the penguin \'Aang\' it fitted each of the characters\xe2\x80\x94and wrote the emails and signed up in Build-a-Bear account with a credit card if any of her children wanted to order anything online and paid $400 dollars of the toys with extra clothes, with their own bedrooms and closet to go with it.The girls thanked Hermione for their toys and hugged her which she murmured \'no problems luv\' as they walked around the mall hoping the girls didn\'t want any more toys since they bought today. After a long hour Hermione and the girls were finally done with their shopping as much as she loves to shop for clothes it was the best she can do since she has so much money she doesn\'t know what to do with it until she made college funds for the children when they head to university college either muggle or wizarding world.They decided to get something to eat\xe2\x80\x94more like a snack and the kids were beginning to get tired from a long today\xe2\x80\x94Hermione steadied the kids and put them inside their strollers as they were taking a nap after a long day today since her three sons were with their uncle and godfather Jay in the other side of the mall and met up at the food court."Since the kids are asleep maybe we can look around to look for new shoes or something?" Hermione offered.Jay smirked "You read my mind baby sis," he began to say pushing one stroller-Rose, Daisy, Amelia and Hugo while Hermione pushed the other stroller-James, Seth, Lily, Evie and Hugo who were taking their nap or else they\'ll be extra cranky while the eldest kids-Logan, Zander, CJ, Sophia, Newton, Nelson, Arianna and Hannah were busy chatting into conversation.It\'s so hard to believe that his kids are teenagers once more and soon they\'ll be graduating within 4-5 years from now once they sat down on the benches to rest while their kids went to the arcade to play; once they were by themselves Jay decided to speak up after a short silence."So\xe2\x80\xa6 how are you feeling from the last time we talked?" Jay asked."I\'m fine," Hermione lied at this sipping her smoothie which Jay gave her a stern look "Really I am,""Cookie\xe2\x80\xa6 what did I tell you about lying to me since we both know that\'s a bloody lie,""Jay\xe2\x80\xa6I\'m fine really\xe2\x80\xa6" Hermione began to say causing Jay to give a glower \'I don\'t believe you,\' look causing her to sigh "Why is it whenever I talk to you and Ariel you always give me that look\xe2\x80\xa6" she murmured."Because we both know you making it seem you\'re okay despite how you\'re not fine\xe2\x80\xa6 you haven\'t been since you lost your husband Harry nugget\xe2\x80\xa6 we both haven\'t\xe2\x80\xa6 I haven\'t been the same since I lost Mal while you lost Harry,""Okay fine\xe2\x80\xa6 I\'m \xe2\x80\xa6. having a hard time without my husband and my best friends\xe2\x80\xa6I don\'t know what else you want me to say\xe2\x80\xa6 that would make the pain go away Jay-Jay especially since the quints\xe2\x80\x94" Hermione stopped looking at her children\xe2\x80\x94the quints sleeping soundly from their nap "They look so much like their father especially his eyes \xe2\x80\xa6then there\'s Rosie, Daisy, Amelia and Hugo who remind me of Ron and Susan\xe2\x80\xa6how do you move on from all of that\xe2\x80\xa6" she whispered.Jay grew quiet staring at his little sister as he put his arms behind his head "Who said I was\xe2\x80\xa6 I don\'t think that pain losing the love of your life will never go away but, I don\'t expect you to tell me everything nugget\xe2\x80\xa6" he drifted off as he watched his eldest kids watching over the little ones eating their late lunch "After all it\'s not every day that you lose the love of your life\xe2\x80\xa6you don\'t think I haven\'t been through it either\xe2\x80\xa6 I lost someone that I love too \xe2\x80\xa6 I know it\'s hard believe me I know exactly how you feel but, feeling sorry for yourself in self-pity pretending to be okay in front of others it\'s a load of bullocks nugget," he explained."No I\'m not Jay,""Yes, you are\xe2\x80\xa6 Harry would\'ve want you to live your life and be happy\xe2\x80\xa6 and watch over the kids\xe2\x80\xa6 that includes Ron and Susan\xe2\x80\xa6 as they picked you as their children\'s godmother to their kids for a reason\xe2\x80\xa6 I\'m sure they would have agreed with Harry on that one," Jay explained."I don\'t feel sorry for myself Jay,""Bull shit,""Jay,""What I\'m just being honest here," Jay snorted at this "Come on Mia do you really want to lie yourself\xe2\x80\xa6 you can deny that you\'re okay in front of others but, not with me\xe2\x80\xa6 or Ariel\xe2\x80\xa6 not because I\'m your brother or Ariel being our sister since we both know you so well\xe2\x80\xa6 you keep your emotions to yourself \xe2\x80\xa6 even Draco and the others can tell\xe2\x80\xa6 including the kids you can act like you\'re completely fine when in reality you\'re not\xe2\x80\xa6 " he began to say noticing Hermione to bow her head sadly as he lifted her chin to look at him "Harry wouldn\'t want you to be sad over his death\xe2\x80\xa6 he would\'ve want you to be move on just like Mal would want me to move on, fall in love again and be the best parent for our kids \xe2\x80\xa6 most of all they would\'ve want us to be happy like we\'re supposed too," he explained.Hermione grew quiet staring at her brother "A-a-are you saying that you\'re readying to date\xe2\x80\xa6 despite how you\'re a single widow father of eight children\xe2\x80\xa6" she began to say giving him a pointing look "Then why are you still wearing your wedding ring then?" she whispered."Why are you still wearing yours," Jay pointed out.Apparently it made them both quiet causing Hermione to sigh "I don\'t think I can ever fall in love and\xe2\x80\xa6 move on\xe2\x80\xa6 I love him to much... that\'s\xe2\x80\xa6a very scary thought Jay\xe2\x80\xa6" she whispered."It might be yes\xe2\x80\xa6I\'m not saying I\'m going to date right now...it\'s still a bit \xe2\x80\xa6sensitive for me \xe2\x80\xa6 seeing as I\'m not ready to date yet... but, one day I will and once I\'m ready to do date \xe2\x80\xa6 in my own pace\xe2\x80\xa6Mal and I talked about it \xe2\x80\xa6.before the war gotten dangerous\xe2\x80\xa6 if one of us weren\'t going to make it...to heal\xe2\x80\xa6 from the loss and meet someone new... and fell in love again \xe2\x80\xa6 we\'ll be okay with it\xe2\x80\xa6 because we want them to be happy \xe2\x80\xa6wouldn\'t you feel the same way if you and Harry switched\xe2\x80\x94you losing your life and you will tell him to move on with your life while watching over the kids?""Of course, I want him to be happy but, I don\'t expect him to wait for me forever,""And I\'m pretty sure he wouldn\'t want you to expect to wait for him either,""It\'s still early for me to date Jay\xe2\x80\xa6 I just lost my husband\xe2\x80\xa6it\'s been 3 \xc2\xbd years...it\'s too soon""Exactly, it\'s been 3 \xc2\xbd years\xe2\x80\xa6and I know it has...

Jay\xe2\x80\xa6especially on how I lost Harry\xe2\x80\xa6I miss him so much\xe2\x80\xa6" she blinked her tears while Jay held her close into a hug sobbing over him "I don\'t want to forget him\xe2\x80\xa6 he\'s my husband\xe2\x80\xa6 he\'s the father of our children,""Shhh I know and hey I don\'t think you can ever forget about Harry kiddo\xe2\x80\xa6" Jay murmured holding his baby sister Hermione rocking her back and forth "It\'s okay... it\'s okay\xe2\x80\xa6 just let it out nugget it\'s going to be okay\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s okay to miss him to believe me I\'m always going to love and miss Mal more than you ever know but, we can\'t \xe2\x80\xa6 keep living in the past\xe2\x80\xa6 I think it\'s time for us to move on kid and to do that\xe2\x80\xa6 we have to move on with our lives..." he whispered.Hermione grew quiet "I don\'t know if I can\xe2\x80\xa6" she whispered."And that\'s completely understandable \xe2\x80\xa6 if you want to live your life watching your kids grow up \xe2\x80\xa6 watch them fall in love and have a family\xe2\x80\xa6 that\'s okay too\xe2\x80\xa6 but, I\'m pretty sure the kids would want you to be happy too,"Hermione grew quiet "It\'s a bit sudden don\'t you think?""Like I said take your time\xe2\x80\xa6 heal your heart\xe2\x80\xa6 you have plenty of time to do that\xe2\x80\xa6 but, don\'t you want to fall in love and get married again?""I don\'t think there\'s going to another marriage for me anytime soon\xe2\x80\xa6 since Harry\'s my soul mate Jay\xe2\x80\xa6""And I get it I really do \xe2\x80\xa6 Mal is the love of my life\xe2\x80\xa6 my soulmate\xe2\x80\xa6but, she would\'ve understood just like Harry would\xe2\x80\xa6 they will always love us just like we will always\xe2\x80\xa6 always love them no matter what,"Hermione grew quiet "Maybe\xe2\x80\xa6"Neither of them noticed that Logan, Zander, CJ, Sophia, Nelson, Newton and Teddy watched from afar seeing their dad Jay and their auntie Hermione were having a heart-to-heart talk, Hanna and Arianna were playing with their new toys while their youngest cousins James, Seth, Henry, Rose, Lily, Evie, Hugo, Daisy, and Amelia were taking their naps inside their strollers.Logan\'s P.O.V."Hey Logan\xe2\x80\xa6" Zander spoke up between the silence seeing their dad Jay and their auntie Hermione talking in low tones."Yeah Zayne," I murmured."Would you be okay if dad were ready to date again\xe2\x80\xa6" Zander asked.I looked at my dad with this sad look on his face; he\'s been extra depressed ever since we lost our mom eight years ago\xe2\x80\x94that was until our godfather Charlie helped him heal I seen the way they looked at each other but, I wasn\'t sure how I felt about it before\xe2\x80\xa6 because well our mom just died I always been close to my mom but, seeing my dad wanting to move on with his life it would make sense since I do want my dad to be happy but, with my auntie Hermione who happened to be our godmother 3 \xc2\xbd years later after our mum died we were attacked again\xe2\x80\x94well mostly in St. Mungo\'s where our auntie Hermione/godmother worked while our extended cousins being our best friends were killed by being attacked in the Burrow being burned alive\xe2\x80\xa6 it was a horrid sight to find out about that.We were very saddening to hear that our uncle Harry including the rest of our aunts and uncles who got killed 3 \xc2\xbd years ago as he instantly got killed from the raid attacks of death eaters in St. Mungo\'s killing everyone in sight\xe2\x80\x94it wasn\'t a pleasant scene I remember that day clearly\xe2\x80\x94My auntie Hermione got hurt but, they rushed to St. Mungo\'s I guess uncle Harry must\'ve saved her from the attacks or else we would\'ve lost both of them and no one would\'ve watched the quints or uncle Ron and auntie Susan\'s children maybe auntie Ariel or my dad but, it would\'ve been a lot of kids or maybe uncle Charlie, uncle Fred and uncle George? Who knows but, all I know is it changed a lot for everyone especially my aunt Hermione.I guess that\'s one of the reasons why we\'re moving to America to start fresh. My dad told us during our stay in Hogwarts that we\'re going to be moving before our next term in Hogwarts we were devastated and hurt not wanting to be away from our friends but, at the same time I can understand why because Forks, Washington was where my siblings and I were born so in a way I guess I\'m a little excited to come back to see our old friends there\xe2\x80\xa6 at least I hope they still there anyway."Yeah I think I will be besides\xe2\x80\xa6 I have a feeling dad will be happy either he has someone or not \xe2\x80\xa6. Mom would\'ve want him to be happy and I think we should be happy for dad, too don\'t you?" I asked casually.Zander grew quiet looking at dad then at me with a small smile "I think so too\xe2\x80\xa6""Good then we\'re in agreement then hmm?""Yeah, we\'re definitely are,""Hey CJ, what about you? Aren\'t you excited to live in America?" Teddy asked.CJ shrugged "Not really\xe2\x80\xa6 I mean my friends are in Hogwarts\xe2\x80\xa6" he drifted off with a distant look "But, I guess starting fresh to a new place can\'t be too bad, right?"Teddy shrugged "I wouldn\'t know but, I heard from my parents that auntie Minnie and your dad with auntie Ariel were born in this town," he murmured."How you heard that?" I asked."Wolf hearing remember," Teddy murmured."Oh right\xe2\x80\xa6 you\'re part\xe2\x80\xa6" I drifted off as Teddy nodded at this "I kind of figured that much,""You\'re not mad?" Teddy asked."Mad why would I be mad about that? I think that\'s pretty cool," Newton answered."Yeah what he said," Nelson quickly added.Teddy beamed "Thanks guys that really means a lot to me \xe2\x80\xa6 since my dad had a hard time \xe2\x80\xa6 growing up before he met uncle James, uncle Sirius ... and Pettigrew\xe2\x80\xa6 before he betrayed them\xe2\x80\xa6 causing them to \xe2\x80\xa6 split up \xe2\x80\xa6 and now they\'re gone\xe2\x80\xa6 and I\'m just glad that I won\'t be alone I have you guys along with my parents, auntie Minnie and the rest of the lot,""Exactly we\'ll be moving to America together from what my dad said anyway I think that\'s better than moving by yourself at all," CJ pointed out."Amen to that," Zander explained.I looked at my watch "Hey look they have race car games let\'s check this game out see if it looks good enough to play agreed,""Agreed,"Sophia\'s P.O.V."Logan\xe2\x80\xa6" I murmured."Yeah Sophy," Logan softly says."Do you think daddy\'s sad that momma isn\'t with us anymore,"Logan eyes looked conflicted staring at our dad who was talking to our aunt Hermione "Do you want the truth?" he asked."Yeah\xe2\x80\xa6"Logan steaded his breath "Yeah I really do\xe2\x80\xa6when we lost mum\xe2\x80\xa6 he was pretty bad shape\xe2\x80\xa6 Sophy...but, now after \xe2\x80\xa6 nearly 8 years losing mum\xe2\x80\xa6 I\'m not really sure anymore...I mean he has us\xe2\x80\xa6 obviously with auntie Minnie and our cousins, auntie Ariel, uncle George along with everyone\xe2\x80\xa6 but, I think deep down\xe2\x80\xa6 he\'s a bit lonely \xe2\x80\xa6 and losing mum was probably really hard for dad to talk about\xe2\x80\xa6 since we were pretty young then,""We were only 8 years old, then weren\'t we?" I murmured."We were\xe2\x80\xa6but, it was after the year we left America remember\xe2\x80\xa6 Forks, Washington then-" Logan began to say in low tones "But, that doesn\'t mean that dad\'s alone he still has us he will always have us," he explained."Yeah I remember\xe2\x80\xa6 " I began to say in murmur tones "But, I also remember mama promise and what she told us though?" she whispered."What did you remember from mum promise?" Logan asked."She said that if anything were to happen to her or with daddy we\'d be under full custody with auntie Minnie or auntie Ariel being our aunts and godmothers," I pointed out.Logan slowly nodded at this "She did say that...yeah... she also said if she died first... we\'d take care of dad," he explained."Yeah we pinky promise mama... we\'d take care of daddy... and we did took care of him didn\'t we?" I asked.~*~End of Chapter Eleven~*~Whooooooo! I can\'t believe I finish the first half-well the first ten chapters and now finishing Ch. 11 and I\'m on a roll to write more (lol) I\'m sure you\'re noticing there\'s a few changes of errors and rewritten the whole thing again and hope to get more reviewers fans that way but, more than that I hope you keep supporting me until the end. Ciao for now ^_^\nChapter Twelve: Distracting Hermione (Part 1)Sophia\'s P.O.V.Logan sighed tiredly "She did say that huh\xe2\x80\xa6" he murmured."Yeah she did \xe2\x80\xa6mama also said that if either of them were killed...like with mama... if she got killed first...we\'d promise to take care of daddy... or if daddy got killed we\'d take care of mama... remember and if either mama or daddy were to fall in love again we\'d be happy for them right?" I explained."Yeah but, we were only eight years old...though," Logan weakly says."We were...but, we promise mama...I don\'t want to break my promise to her\xe2\x80\xa6we pinky promise Logan," I whispered."Yeah \xe2\x80\xa6 we did promise her huh\xe2\x80\xa6" Logan began to say staring at dad then back at me giving a defeated sigh "Damn\xe2\x80\xa6 I guess this is what she meant huh.." he murmured."Who?" I asked all confuse."Don\'t worry about it\xe2\x80\xa6 I think your right Soph\xe2\x80\xa6 if dad were to fall in love again\xe2\x80\xa6 we\'ll always be a family no matter who he be with... " Logan began to say leaning against the bench "We can\'t break our promise\xe2\x80\xa6" he murmured."No we can\'t and yeah we promise mama we\'d be happy for daddy if he were to fall in love again wouldn\'t we?" I murmured."We did\xe2\x80\xa6 " Logan murmured."So\xe2\x80\xa6 are we going to let daddy be happy\xe2\x80\xa6on whoever he be with\xe2\x80\xa6don\'t you want daddy to be happy" I whispered.Logan eyes soften at this "Of course I do\xe2\x80\xa6 we all do Sophy\xe2\x80\xa6 but, that\'s really up to dad but, I don\'t think he can replace mum \xe2\x80\xa6 so it depends really\xe2\x80\xa6 do you want dad to meet someone new and we also promise that we take care of dad too," he murmured."And we did\xe2\x80\xa6 sort of\xe2\x80\xa6 but, mostly auntie Ariel and auntie Minnie helped most of it including uncle Charlie," I argued back."Yeah\xe2\x80\xa6 I guess he did huh\xe2\x80\xa6he helped us a lot over the years that we grew close to one another didn\'t we""Best friends even\xe2\x80\xa6 and I think they both love each other secretly\xe2\x80\xa6""What makes you think that?""They way they look at each other like how daddy looks at mama\xe2\x80\xa6 I think it\'s a sign from mama\xe2\x80\xa6""Do you want\xe2\x80\xa6 dad to be with uncle Charlie Sophy?" Logan asked.I grew quiet "I don\'t know\xe2\x80\xa6 I never seen daddy without mummy before\xe2\x80\xa6 but, I do want daddy to be happy," she whispered.Logan hugged his little sister "Me too kiddo me too\xe2\x80\xa6""Do you think daddy will meet someone new\xe2\x80\xa6 unless he already did meet someone?" I whispered."Like who uncle Charlie?""Maybe\xe2\x80\xa6 I mean \xe2\x80\xa6 you don\'t think that\'s weird \xe2\x80\xa6 I mean would you be okay with that?"Logan leaned against the bench "Probably not at first but, eventually mum would want us to be supportive and be happy over dad so\xe2\x80\xa6 yeah \xe2\x80\xa6 it might take some time but, I\'ll be happy for dad even if he\'s with uncle Charlie,""Good\xe2\x80\xa6 "I murmured."Why are you asking me this anyway?"I leaned my head against his shoulder "Because I want daddy to be happy even if it\'s with uncle Charlie and I\'m pretty sure mama would\'ve been okay with it like how you stare at Zoey when you think no one\'s watching since we\'re going back home in America maybe \xe2\x80\xa6 who knows you\'ll see her again," she murmured.Logan gawked at me with a weird look "What?" he squeaked "I don\'t like Brooks,""Who said anything about Brooks?" I gave an innocent look "All I said you stare at Zoey there\'s only 10 Zoey\'s in our school back in America so how can I possible know it was Zoey Brooks that I was talking about hmm?" I explained.Logan gape at me for a long moment, opening and close his mouth for ten minutes "Sneaky\xe2\x80\xa6 very sneaky and evil \xe2\x80\xa6 you probably got that from mum," he murmured.Sophia grinned at this causing Logan to roll his eyes "But, you loooove for me for it since we\'re best friends right?""Yeah best friends till the end come on we should get back dad and auntie Minnie are probably waiting for us,""We have some time I heard auntie Minnie and daddy talking we can stay another half hour,""Perfect now I can play with this game since it\'s not 7:00 yet that\'s when we have to go back for the party remember," Logan began to say only to see his little cousins slowly waking up "Hey munchkins did you have a nice nap?" he explained.James yawned cutely "Uh huh \xe2\x80\xa6 daddy was with us and he made momma happy," he murmured.Logan soften his eyes over his cousins "I bet it was a good dream huh kiddo,""Uh huh\xe2\x80\xa6""Do you want to play games with us?""Okay,"That was until Henry, Seth, Evie, Lily, Rose, Daisy, Amelia and Hugo woke up not far away giving a small yawn "Well, well, well, looks like the rest of the crew is awake. You want to play games with us?"Seth blinked his eyes "Okay," he murmured where Logan took off their strap belt off carrying two out of time of their strollers "Where\'s my momma?""Your mum\'s over there with my dad?" Logan pointed out at this causing Seth to look at their mum and uncle Jay."I\'ma tell momma we\'re awake okay,""Okay," Sophia nodded at this "I\'ll go with you so that way you won\'t get hurt,""I\'m a big boy I don\'t need you to go with me?"Sophia giggled "Either way I\'m still going with you Sethyboo you\'re my little cousin I\'m always here to protect you no matter how old you are,"Seth pouted "Okay," he sadly says causing Sophia to giggle as they explained to Hermione and their dad Jay that James, Seth, Lily, Evie, Rose, Daisy, Amelia and Hugo woke up from their naps as they passed the strollers to them since the kids are now awake."So what they say?""They said that we can take the kids inside the arcade for an hour since daddy said that we\'re going home around 7 instead of 6 since it\'s still early and it\'s only 5:45 p.m. so we have 2 \xc2\xbd hours left before we go home,""Cool, we can play at the arcade I want to check out this new game that I heard from Chase apparently it\'s pretty popular for muggles,""You and your video games,""Oh yeah at least I\'m not into stuff animals? What are you a little kid and why did you buy a \xe2\x80\xa6 whatever that is?""This is Hello Kitty auntie Minnie bought it for me and I\'m going to cherish it forever," I began to say squinting my eyes at my older brother Logan "Besides.. It\'s a new collection for girls my age so get over it," she explain by poking her tongue at her brother."Now, now," Zander and CJ putting their shoulders around us "No fighting we promised auntie Minnie that we wouldn\'t fight especially since this is our l2nd last day this week,""Isn\'t it our 3rd last week since we\'re leaving in Friday,""Oh right\xe2\x80\xa6 what time are we leaving again?""Around midnight our flight is 3:00 in the morning,""Jeez\xe2\x80\xa6 that\'s early...at least we won\'t be followed dad said it\'s annoying to have the paparazzi following us everywhere,""It really is huh?"Logan stretched his neck "I don\'t like Brooks," he grumbled at this causing Sophia to smug at this."Who\'s Brooks?" CJ asked all confuse.Sophia was about to open her mouth but, Zander cut her off "Kacey\'s best friend and happens to be Hayley\'s little cousin," he explained."How do you know that?" CJ asked.Zander smirked "Oh \xe2\x80\xa6 I have my ways CJ\xe2\x80\xa6 I have my ways\xe2\x80\xa6""Yeah and your Gryffindor Pride to boot," Arianna grumbled causing her brothers to laugh as they reached inside the arcade carrying their little cousins steadying them on their arms not wanting them to get lost "Oh look what\'s this game about?""Down, down, down," James pouted "Aria down,""Okay, okay Jamie Jam just don\'t go running off okay," Arianna murmured."I\'ll be good," James nodded at this as he\'s now standing up with his siblings as they were curious over the game "I\'ll stay here," he explained."Okay just stay close," Hanna murmured keeping an eye out "How do we play this game anyway?""You just throw the ball in the basket," another kid explained causing Arianna and Hanna to nearly jumped."Who are you?"The kid raised his eyebrow at the girl "\xe2\x80\xa6 Kai\xe2\x80\xa6 I\'m Kai and I work here?""Oh\xe2\x80\xa6" Arianna flushed at this hiding behind her brother Logan who didn\'t noticed until she peeked behind him "Errmm\xe2\x80\xa6 so how do I play this again?""It\'s basketball surely you would know that don\'t you?" Kai asked raising his eyebrow at this."Umm\xe2\x80\xa6 no\xe2\x80\xa6 I\'m not familiar with \xe2\x80\xa6 sports like this\xe2\x80\xa6" Arianna flushed at this while her brothers narrowed dangerously at the guy "Sorry.." she squeaked at this."Right\xe2\x80\xa6 "Kai slowly nod at this "Well it\'s quite easy you just grab the ball," he demonstrated it "Make sure you stand behind this line here\xe2\x80\xa6and score it\'s that easy," he explained which Arianna score a basket "See you\'re ready a pro at this,"Arianna flushed "Um thanks\xe2\x80\xa6 CJ. do you want to play?" she asked turning to her brother.CJ nodded at this "Yeah let me take a whack at it," he grinned playing basketball thanks to his dad\'s abilities since he taught them a thing or two when they were young "This is so easy I bet dad would love this game," he explained."I want to try too," Newton and Nelson cried out."Okay, okay there\'s plenty of them over here if you need help," Kai pointed out causing the twins to perk up."Brilliant," Newton and Nelson beamed at this setting up the game next to their brothers and started playing."Well\xe2\x80\xa6 at least we know one of the American sports\xe2\x80\xa6that\'s not hard to play" Sophia murmured."Let\'s try this game Sophy?" Teddy asked pointing at the motorcycle racing."Okay," Sophia nodded at this "How do you play this game?""Auntie Minnie showed me all you gotta do is win a race watch and use this coin she showed me how to use it," Teddy began to say setting the motorcycle, paint it blue and gold with a few adjustments and then started the game "Watch this I\'m going to win this game and set a new record," he explained."You\'re doing it Teddy whooooooo! Watch out from the other player \xe2\x80\xa6 turn, turn, brakkee," Sophy insisted "Eeek! Watch out," she cried out."How are you so good at this Teddy?" Hanna cried out already into the game."Auntie Minnie showed me how to play this game Whooooo! I\'m in way ahead of the other players I\'m a pro at this," Teddy cried out."GO TEDDY!?" Sophia, Arianna and Hanna cheered for their friend which left Teddy flush and grinned at his friends and ended up in 1rst place cheering excitedly while holding their little cousins hands."That was fun," Teddy chuckled at this "You want to try a different game?""Yeah let\'s go," Hanna cried out not realizing that Harry was watching the kids from the shadows not in a creepy way but, in a guardian angel kind of way."Hey, Logan, we\'re going to look around okay," Sophia asked."Yeah, yeah, sure," Logan called out as he was really into the basketball game "Stay together okay and be sure to watch our cousins okay since they\'re all with you,""Will do," Sophia replied.Hanna\'s P.O.V."Hey Aria, look," I murmured causing my sisters Aria and Sophia to turn to where I was looking."What is it Han?" Aria asked as she tugged Sophia who looked confuse "What is it?""Did you see that Sophy?""No\xe2\x80\xa6. what are we looking at?"I squinted my eyes a bit "I\xe2\x80\x94I don\'t know\xe2\x80\xa6Teddy\xe2\x80\xa6?" she asked tugging his jacket."Yeah \xe2\x80\xa6?" Teddy asked."Can you come here please\xe2\x80\xa6." I murmured.Teddy was about to answer but, was cut off by the quints\xe2\x80\x94James, Seth, Lily, Evie & Henry walked over to the stranger man causing us to widen our eyes in horror "The quints," I cried out rushing over my little cousins "James, Seth, Lily, Evie, Henry Potter you get back here," I hissed at them which the quints ignored my cries."Rosie come on," Lily dragging her sister who yelled as they followed them."Where are we going Lily," Rose asked."Look it\'s my daddy," Lily whispered.Rose being the curious one dragged Daisy, Amelia and Hugo "Come on guys let\'s go follow them," she whispered."Okay," Daisy murmured dragging Amelia and Hugo who followed not far behind."Oh no\xe2\x80\xa6 why oh why would they go to the stranger they know they\'re not supposed to do that," Sophia panicked running over to her cousins "James Sirius, Seth Oliver Cameron, Lillian Luna, Evelynn Sophia Carson and Harrison Jacob Daniel Potter, Rosalynn Taylor, Daisy Jasmine, Amelia Susan and Hugo Joseph Weasley-Potter where in Merlin are you guys going?" she cried out."Daddy!" James and the quints cried out causing them to pale."Daddy\xe2\x80\xa6." Sophia paled at this as if she saw a ghost "But, James\xe2\x80\xa6 that\'s not your\xe2\x80\x94" she stopped to blink her eyes dumbly "Daddy\xe2\x80\xa6" she drifted off and felt that familiar feeling in her heart "Uncle Harry\xe2\x80\xa6" she murmured running after her cousins not wanting them to get kidnapped from that stranger."Sophy what are you doing?" Arianna cried out running after her sister dragging Hannah "Wait for us,""Uh oh\xe2\x80\xa6" Teddy looked at his godmother/ auntie Hermione and Jay his uncle who also happens to be his godfather who were chatting around outside the arcade "Ah bloody hell \xe2\x80\xa6 this is what happens when we have so many toys," he swore under his breath and sighed running after the quints, Sophia, Aria and Hannah "Why is it whenever we go out our little cousins always end up being curious over things," he explained."Hanna, Sophy, James, Seth, Lily, Evie, Henry come back, Rosie! Daisy! Amelia! Hugo! You get back here right now" Aria cried out in horror as she stopped and froze as her face paled looking at the stranger "Uncle Harry\xe2\x80\xa6" she whispered.The stranger hugs the quints being his children along with his godchildren as if it was a natural for them hugging his kids until they were interrupted by his nieces who happens to be his goddaughters who\'s now a teenager."Hey!" Hanna cried out "Get away from them you\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x94" she hissed at them causing the stranger to freeze looking up to see his eldest niece "Uncle Harry..." she murmured."Sophy\xe2\x80\xa6?" the stranger froze seeing his niece although he confuse the girls to one another "Hold on you can see me?""Yeah we can see you what are you like a ghost or something?" Aria sarcastically says."Err\xe2\x80\xa6 kind of\xe2\x80\xa6"Hanna freeze up "Back up a second\xe2\x80\xa6you thought I was Sophy\xe2\x80\xa6 when I\'m not I\'m Han\xe2\x80\x94wait a minute\xe2\x80\xa6 how do you know my sister?" she harshly hissed at him "Who are you?""I\'m Sophy that\'s Hannah not that it matters but, get away from my cousins," Sophia growled protectively her sisters and Teddy "You-you-you evil ghost," she hissed at him.The stranger chuckled "I apologize and no I\'m not an evil ghost... I\'m just surprised you guys can see me\xe2\x80\xa6 besides\xe2\x80\xa6 well it wouldn\'t matter\xe2\x80\xa6 I haven\'t seen you since you were little\xe2\x80\xa6" he murmured."How\xe2\x80\x94who are you?""I\'m your uncle\xe2\x80\xa6 you were really young then\xe2\x80\xa6when you last saw me. You really can see me?"Hanna, Sophia and Arianna grabbed the quints\xe2\x80\x94James, Seth, Lily, Evie & Henry to our sides despite they\'re protest along with Rose, Daisy, Amelia and Hugo being held back by Teddy."Sophy let me go, let me go it\'s my daddy!" Lily cried out trying to get out her cousin\'s grip "Daddy," she cried out."Sweetie that\'s not your daddy\xe2\x80\xa6" Sophia gently says to her cousin."Yes, it is it\'s my daddy!" Lily cried out and finally got out of her grasp to hug her dad despite how she tried to hug her dad but, the spirit of her father failed through and fell causing her to whimper that Seth helped her sister up with a whimper"Daddy?" Seth murmured "A-are you a ghost?"The stranger sighed at this "I\'m sorry\xe2\x80\xa6 Seth \xe2\x80\xa6 this is my form\xe2\x80\xa6" he murmured as he tried to pat his son on the head while Sophia, Arianna, Hanna and Teddy paled at this "It\'s okay guys I\'m not a ghost at least\xe2\x80\xa6 not that I know of any way\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s me\xe2\x80\xa6your uncle\xe2\x80\xa6 Harry\xe2\x80\xa6" he murmured."Daddy\xe2\x80\xa6" Evie whimpered."Shhh it\'s okay Evie I\'m here\xe2\x80\xa6 daddy\'s here\xe2\x80\xa6" Harry murmured."You can\'t be him because he\'s dead\xe2\x80\xa6" Sophia paled at this "My uncle Harry\xe2\x80\xa6he\'s been dead for 3 \xc2\xbd years\xe2\x80\xa6" she choked up at this "People can\'t come back from the dead\xe2\x80\xa6" she whimpered hiding her face against Teddy who held her close with a conflicted look."I know\xe2\x80\xa6 I was there\xe2\x80\xa6 luv\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s really me\xe2\x80\xa6""How do I know that\xe2\x80\xa6 you could be in my imagination\xe2\x80\xa6it can\'t be\xe2\x80\xa6hallucinating\xe2\x80\xa6 am I going crazy\xe2\x80\xa6 Teddy""If you were \xe2\x80\xa6 I would\'ve been crazy too\xe2\x80\xa6 seeing my godfather in front of me again\xe2\x80\xa6""We only have\xe2\x80\xa6 three uncles who are alive right now so try again?" Aria demanded at this cutting Sophia\'s off.The stranger licks his lips nervously looking through the window he needed to get them to believe him somehow "You see her\xe2\x80\xa6" he points at our aunt Hermione causing us to nod at this "I\'m her husband?""Husband\xe2\x80\xa6. "Teddy paled at this squinting his eyes widen noticing the stranger showed some of his face from the light "Uncle Harry?" he began to say as his voice was hoarse walking backwards stunned as if he saw a ghost "Is\xe2\x80\x94is that really you\xe2\x80\xa6how\xe2\x80\x94is this possible \xe2\x80\xa6 and here I thought I was hallucinating" he choked up at this "Y-y-y-you\'re-you\'re," he whispered since he can\'t form any words staring at him."Hey pup\xe2\x80\xa6." The stranger looked teared up revealed as Harry began to say choked up seeing his godson Teddy "You look so grown up now\xe2\x80\xa6 "he murmured."How are you\xe2\x80\xa6" Teddy took a step back having a hard time breathing "How are you alive\xe2\x80\xa6dad said you died from the mission along with uncle Ron\xe2\x80\xa6 auntie Susan\xe2\x80\xa6 and the Weasley\'s \xe2\x80\xa6 they\xe2\x80\x94" he was choked up "Grandpa Arthur\xe2\x80\xa6 nana Molly\xe2\x80\xa6 uncle Bill... auntie Fleur\xe2\x80\xa6 Victoire \xe2\x80\xa6 Dominique and the rest of the lot \xe2\x80\xa6 are dead\xe2\x80\xa6 they were killed burned alive in a fire at the Burrow no one survived\xe2\x80\xa6 thanks to those\xe2\x80\x94" he was so choked up that Sophia held her little cousin "That\'s not possible\xe2\x80\xa6no one can\'t bring anyone back from the dead\xe2\x80\xa6" he murmured."Believe me I know\xe2\x80\xa6 and it\'s \xe2\x80\xa6 kind a long story," Harry murmured."How do I know this isn\'t a trick," Teddy demanded knowing it could be his imagination wiping his tears despite how he\'s all choked up by the whole thing."It\'s not\xe2\x80\xa6" Harry revealing himself from the light causing Teddy, Arianna and Hannah along with the kids "You saw me twice today at the grave\xe2\x80\xa6 and the zoo\xe2\x80\xa6"Teddy paled at this "That was you\xe2\x80\xa6" he whispered."It was\xe2\x80\xa6" Harry nodded at this "I always been watching over you guys\xe2\x80\xa6 keeping a look out from danger\xe2\x80\xa6 that was all me\xe2\x80\xa6" he whispered."What do you mean by the grave? What grave?" Arianna asked."The grave where uncle Harry was buried\xe2\x80\xa6 along with the Weasley\'s\xe2\x80\xa6auntie Minnie hide the location away from the reporters by not wanting them to find them with the strongest wards and powerful jinxes with a password of her choice, "Teddy whispered."Oh\xe2\x80\xa6." Hanna murmured "If your uncle Harry then whose body did we just bury 3 \xc2\xbd years ago,"Harry held his breath "There\'s no body\xe2\x80\xa6" he murmured.Teddy, Sophia, Arianna and Hanna looked at him with wide eyes "What Do You Mean There\'s No Body?!" Arianna exclaimed."Shhh," Harry shushes his nieces along with the kids rushing into the shadows putting a silence charm "Are you crazy you can\'t just blurt out that out people can hear," he cried out."Sorry\xe2\x80\xa6 I just\xe2\x80\xa6 this is crazy\xe2\x80\xa6 you\'re supposed to be dead\xe2\x80\xa6" Arianna cried out rushing her fingers through her hair in a stressful way."I know\xe2\x80\xa6 I know\xe2\x80\xa6listen Aria\xe2\x80\xa6 Sophy\xe2\x80\xa6Teddy\xe2\x80\xa6 Han you guys can\'t tell anyone especially Mione," Harry cried out."Why not," Teddy demanded at this feeling quite protective over his godmother "If you\'re really uncle Harry you would\'ve told her that you\'re alive instead of making her feel so \xe2\x80\xa6 empty\xe2\x80\xa6from the past 3 \xc2\xbd years," he murmured."You don\'t think I haven\'t tried everything to communicate with your godmother Teddy. I can\'t\xe2\x80\xa6" Harry bowed his head in shame "I can\'t\xe2\x80\xa6 ""Why not," Teddy argued back."Because \xe2\x80\xa6. I\'m still stuck\xe2\x80\xa6" Harry replied."Stuck where?" Teddy asked."Somewhere\xe2\x80\xa6 I wish I knew where but, it\'s so complicated to say out loud especially here Teddy listen to me I know it\'s a lot to take in \xe2\x80\xa6 but, you must promise me you can\'t tell your godmother\xe2\x80\xa6 I\'m still inside the egg..." Harry cried out."Egg\xe2\x80\xa6 what egg like a bird egg or a chicken egg""I\'m pretty sure I\'m not either of those\xe2\x80\xa6since I\'m still me but, I know I\'m inside an egg Teddy...I know it doesn\'t make any sense right now but, how much do you know about creature inheritances?""Not a lot \xe2\x80\xa6 but, dad and mum told me about them\xe2\x80\xa6 why?""I read about them from auntie Minnie?""Of course, you did well what do you know about them?""Well it depends on the creature inheritance \xe2\x80\xa6 some survived\xe2\x80\xa6 in different \xe2\x80\xa6 atmosphere \xe2\x80\xa6it really depends really \xe2\x80\xa6 is that what happen to you uncle Harry?"Harry held his breath "It is \xe2\x80\xa6apparently my creature inheritance was through my parents\xe2\x80\xa6my dad was \xe2\x80\xa6 a shapeshifter which ones I have no idea\xe2\x80\xa6 which is why is taking me so long\xe2\x80\xa6 to come home\xe2\x80\xa6to hatch since I\'m not in my habitat to do that I have to hatch and right now I have no idea where I am..." he drifted off with a sad look looking at his wife through the window glass behind the shadows "Believe me I want to tell your aunt Hermione everything but, since it\'s kind of hard to walk through I don\'t have a way to communicate and I don\'t stay long,""What do you mean uncle Harry?""For me I\'m still hatching from the egg \xe2\x80\xa6 and I\'m near an ocean\xe2\x80\xa6 at least\xe2\x80\xa6 that\'s what \xe2\x80\xa6 I\'m told\xe2\x80\xa6 anyway\xe2\x80\xa6""Like \xe2\x80\xa6 a water demon?""No\xe2\x80\xa6 more like \xe2\x80\xa6between fire and water\xe2\x80\xa6 I think\xe2\x80\x94" Harry looked over to his wife Hermione then turned to Teddy, Hanna, Arianna and the quints "Listen I don\'t have much time we\'ll talk more later," he explained.Teddy not wanting to be away from his godfather "Wait\xe2\x80\xa6what about-if that\'s true then\xe2\x80\xa6 we have to tell auntie Minnie she can help" as he tried to grab Harry but, his hand went through him causing Teddy to pale "What\xe2\x80\xa6 the\xe2\x80\xa6""I told you I can\'t go through Teddy it\'s only for a short time sometimes I would end up in the same place as you guys are but, it doesn\'t last very long\xe2\x80\xa6apparently it\'s one of my powers\xe2\x80\xa6. I\'m projecting\xe2\x80\xa6""Projecting\xe2\x80\xa6 how is that possible\xe2\x80\xa6" Teddy murmured."Trust me I\'m been trying to figure that out too\xe2\x80\xa6it\'s very frustrating trust me I tried but, it\'s taking whatever creature I am it\'s taking it\'s sweet time to hatch" Harry sighed tiredly "So will you guys promise me not to tell your godmother?"Teddy, Hanna and Arianna looked at each other with a nod at this "We promise\xe2\x80\xa6""Good\xe2\x80\xa6I\'m glad to hear that I can count on you guys on this secret,""But, uncle Harry how will we contact you?" Teddy asked."Don\'t worry I\'ll always find a way I always do," Harry winked playfully "I\'ll see you later pup,""Daddy I don\'t want you to go," Lily and Evie whimpered holding onto her father along with James, Seth and Henry well at least they tried too."Uncle Harry\xe2\x80\xa6 is my daddy alive too\xe2\x80\xa6" Rosie whimpered.Harry gave a sad look "Sorry little Rosie\xe2\x80\xa6 your dad is up there with everyone else\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s just me\xe2\x80\xa6" he whispered.Rose whimpered bowing her head sadly "It\'s not fair\xe2\x80\xa6 I want my daddy too\xe2\x80\xa6""I know Rosie I know\xe2\x80\xa6 but, I can still be your dad\xe2\x80\xa6 you just have to keep me as a secret from your godmother can you do that for me?"Rose pouted nodded at this "I promise," she whimpered."That\'s my girl," Harry murmured patting her on the head."Daddy please don\'t go\xe2\x80\xa6 we got you a present but, momma has it though," Henry whimpered.Harry soften his eyes towards his kids "Oh kiddo I\'ll be with you guys soon luv\xe2\x80\xa6 just take care of your mum huh," he kissed his daughters Lily and Evie on the forehead "And Henry, kids I love the present that you gave me this morning along with the cake \xe2\x80\xa6but, I have to go\xe2\x80\xa6 " he murmured then disappears leaving us to gawk at this while the kids whimpered which left Hanna, Arianna and Teddy to hold their cousins close."Was that real\xe2\x80\xa6did we really talk to uncle Harry\xe2\x80\xa6" Sophia whispered turning to Arianna, Hanna and Teddy who seemed speechless."I don\'t know \xe2\x80\xa6 but, whatever it was \xe2\x80\xa6 we can\'t tell anyone promise," Arianna whispered."Promise," Teddy murmured carrying the quints James, Seth, Lily, Evie, and Henry while Hannah, Sophia and Aria held Rose, Daisy, Amelia and Hugo the quadruplets to meet the others "Let\'s go find the others before auntie Minnie gets worried knowing her," he quickly added causing the girls to nod carrying James, Seth, Lily, Evie, Henry, Rose, Hugo, Amelia & Daisy who met up with Logan, CJ, Sophy, Zander, Newt and Nelson, at the arcade not far ahead."Daddy\xe2\x80\xa6" Henry whimpered reaching his hands for his dad but, no response."Shhh it\'s okay Henry we\'ll see your dad okay\xe2\x80\xa6 hopefully this isn\'t a trick," Sophia murmured not sure how to feel about this especially since she\'s in a big family, she didn\'t realize that her brothers were looking for them."There you guys are where have you guys been?" Logan asked."Walked around the arcade we kind of lost track of time you?" I lied which Teddy, Sophia, and Arianna holding the kids steadying in our arms.Logan nodded at this "We were playing basketball and won so many tickets come on let\'s get our prizes before we meet up with dad and auntie Minnie, so we can get some ice cream later,""Brilliant I always wanted to try the ice cream here," CJ nodded eagerly after they went to get their prizes which they earned 5,000 tickets for winning that much, some muggle toys that Teddy recognized last time he went to muggle London "Let\'s get that big wolf the reddish-brown wolf and the sandy brown one," he announced.Teddy smirked, I can tell he\'s conflicted making it seem he\'s okay when really he\'s conflicted he\'s not the only one we all were "You and your wolves?""Hey now I always been a big wolf," CJ huffed at this causing everyone to nod at this "Besides being a wolf isn\'t too bad it\'s better than vampires that\'s for sure," he explained."True what are you going to name them?" Hannah asked."Hmm\xe2\x80\xa6" CJ gave a \'hum\' sound "This is Jacob\xe2\x80\xa6 and that one is Seth?""Jacob and Seth how come?""I don\'t know\xe2\x80\xa6 auntie Minnie told me that she has some old friends back in Forks maybe they\'re our uncles?" CJ asked."We have a lot of uncles, don\'t we?" Arianna murmured.Teddy nodded at this "Yeah we do\xe2\x80\xa6 at least in auntie Minnie, uncle Jay and auntie Ariel\'s side anyway,""Yeah, I think it was when we were little when we saw them but, I don\'t remember," Sophia asked."I think we were maybe\xe2\x80\xa611 years old when we saw uncle grandpa Charlie Sophy I remember because it was when uncle Harry and auntie Minnie got married five years ago for the 2nd time during their 4th year wedding anniversary remember," Zander pointed out."Oh yeah\xe2\x80\xa6 you would think we\'d know everyone in our family,""Yeah well, we do live in England," Teddy pointed out."True\xe2\x80\xa6 we should give this to auntie Minnie since she has a lot of room in her beaded bag," Arianna nodded at this "I wonder if she can help us extend our backpacks it would be so much easier,""I\'m sure she would since she an undetectable extended charm in my backpack along with the kids so we can hold as much stuff as we want""Really brilliant it would be so much better holding this many bags when we go shopping,""Yeah it really would,""And we can get that ice cream like she promised,""Yeah auntie Minnie did say that it\'s much better than the one in \xe2\x80\xa6 the upper side of England," Newton murmured."It really is," Zander nodded in agreement.Nobody\'s P.O.V.Sophia debated at this as they were a few feet away from their dad Jay and auntie Hermione "Guys\xe2\x80\xa6 what do we do?" Arianna asked in low tones."I don\'t know\xe2\x80\xa6 I really don\'t know\xe2\x80\xa6" Sophia asked running her hand through her hair "I mean how can we\xe2\x80\xa6 explain this to auntie Minnie she\'ll think we\'re mad," she murmured.Hanna looked at their aunt Hermione and their dad "Auntie Minnie wouldn\'t think that not auntie Minnie\xe2\x80\xa6 the others maybe but, not her\xe2\x80\xa6" she murmured."How do you know\xe2\x80\xa6 I mean this is crazy\xe2\x80\xa6 uncle Harry being\xe2\x80\x94" Sophia murmured a silent charm around them "You heard what uncle Harry said to us don\'t you?""We did\xe2\x80\xa6 we were there Sophy we promise him we wouldn\'t say anything\xe2\x80\xa6 and I intend to keep that promise \xe2\x80\xa6 "Hannah murmured."Us too but, what I don\'t understand how did James and the quints knew it was uncle Harry and we didn\'t\xe2\x80\xa6" Sophia began to say staring at their little cousins who were playing with their toys quietly "Even Rose, Daisy, Amelia and Hugo can recognize them\xe2\x80\xa6 and yet we couldn\'t\xe2\x80\xa6 why is that?" she explained."I don\'t know\xe2\x80\xa6 they\'re pretty smart \xe2\x80\xa6 must\'ve got that from their parents\xe2\x80\xa6 uncle Harry and auntie Minnie\xe2\x80\xa6" Arianna murmured."Or maybe it\'s because it\'s their dad they were pretty young when he supposedly \'died\' remember?" Sophia asked using quotations marks."Probably\xe2\x80\xa6" Hanna murmured "We\'ll just have to make sure not be ya know...suspicious knowing daddy he can tell something\'s up?""Well yeah he\'s always been protective with us ever since mummy died\xe2\x80\xa6." Arianna murmured.Sophia sighed "Okay \xe2\x80\xa6look we can\'t tell anyone for now on \xe2\x80\xa6 we keep it to ourselves until we figure this out \xe2\x80\xa6 and keep a look out over the kids \xe2\x80\xa6 and not tell auntie Minnie until we learn more areed,""Agreed," Teddy, Arianna and Hanna murmured shaking their hands noticing that James, Seth, Lily, Evie, Henry, Rose, Daisy, Amelia and Hugo were playing quietly with their toys."They\'re awfully quiet\xe2\x80\xa6 I wonder what\'s wrong?" Hannah asked."Maybe\xe2\x80\xa6 they\'re upset that they can\'t get to their-" Arianna mid-stopped realizing what she might say not wanting to get their hopes up "They\'re probably upset\xe2\x80\xa6 over the whole thing\xe2\x80\xa6it\'s so sad\xe2\x80\xa6" she whispered not realizing that what Aria said will change everything.Jay and Hermione were talking in low tones while Logan, Zander, CJ, Newton, Nelson, and Teddy were still playing video games while Arianna, Sophia and Hanna were debating what to do keeping a promise from their godfather\xe2\x80\xa6 their uncle Harry\xe2\x80\xa6 they were looking quite worried looking back at their aunt Hermione who happens to be their godmother then back at the spot where uncle Harry was which wasn\'t unnoticed from Hermione who noticed the worried looks over her nieces."Hey Jay\xe2\x80\xa6?""Hmmm?""What do you think the girls are talking about right now? They\'ve been awfully quiet and worried about something since they got back with the kids?"Jay blinked his eyes dumbly looking at his daughters who looked away hoping their dad didn\'t figure it out with a raise eyebrow at this "I\'m not sure\xe2\x80\xa6 but, I\'m sure whatever it is \xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s probably\xe2\x80\xa6nothing\xe2\x80\xa6""You sure?" Hermione asked."I\'m positive we never keep secrets from each other," Jay murmured.Hermione sighed "Maybe\xe2\x80\xa6 I mean it could be a girl thing\xe2\x80\xa6 that you can\'t even explain," she began to say with a shrug causing Jay to raise his eyebrow at his sister "What?""What could be a girl thing that they can\'t talk about to me about nugget?""Being a girl\xe2\x80\xa6 there are just some things that you can\'t talk about with their father,""Like what?""Boys\xe2\x80\xa6 shopping\xe2\x80\xa6 boys\xe2\x80\xa6 etc\xe2\x80\xa6""They\'re too young to be thinking about boys especially Sophy,"Hermione snorted "Oh please\xe2\x80\xa6 I\'m sure it\'s nothing but, a little crush and besides it could be something else that they\'re probably talk to me and Ariel about since we been through it at their age?""And what might that be nugget?""Being on your \'time of the month\' that comes every month and the sex talk,"Jay gave a weird look "Oh\xe2\x80\xa6" he shifted uncomfortable coughing awkwardly "Right\xe2\x80\xa6 uhh\xe2\x80\xa6 yeah I think that the girls should talk to you or Ariel with that," he explained.Hermione giggled "Oh don\'t be such a baby every girl goes through it and besides Sophy already had her \'time of the month\' at the age of 9 so I think you\'re good besides Ariel and I already taught her how to use it so I\'m pretty sure she\'s used to it by now just like Hanna and Arianna," she explained"Right\xe2\x80\xa6 right\xe2\x80\xa6" Jay coughed awkwardly "Thank Merlin the boys don\'t have to go through that," he explained.Hermione rolled her eyes "I suppose your right\xe2\x80\xa6" she began to say staring at her nieces who happens to be her goddaughters "Each girl is different so be prepared for the \'cranky\' month Jay," she explained.Jay leaned his head back as he wished his wife Mal would be able to tell their daughters this "It sucks doesn\'t it?" he asked."What does?""Learning new things from the kids... knowing that your spouse would miss it\xe2\x80\xa6 every little thing on what they do\xe2\x80\xa6 especially the girls...I can\'t even \xe2\x80\xa6 imagine how hard that must be for Sophy," Jay murmured as he put his hands over his head "I feel like I failed her\xe2\x80\xa6 "Hermione soften her eyes putting her hand on his shoulder "Jay you didn\'t fail her that girl loves you more than you ever know just like Hannah and Aria does including your sons we all do," she pointed out."Then why does it feel like I failed them I couldn\'t even \xe2\x80\xa6 help my own baby girl go through \xe2\x80\xa6 that time of the month," Jay shifted uncomfortable causing Hermione to giggle "It\'s not funny nugget,""Oh Jay\xe2\x80\xa6 I don\'t think a guy can ever explain that kind of thing only a woman can which is why you got us\xe2\x80\xa6 Ariel and I we\'ll be able to teach her how to go through that," Hermione explained."Thanks nugget I don\'t know what I\'d do I lost you guys\xe2\x80\xa6" Jay murmured."Me either\xe2\x80\xa6 and it is hard\xe2\x80\xa6 " Hermione began to say drifted off with a sad smile "I wish he was with us\xe2\x80\xa6 for the children\xe2\x80\xa6 I miss my husband so much that it hurts\xe2\x80\xa6" she hoarse holding her locket closely as if she can feel Harry\'s presence nearby "It\'s so hard Jay-Jay how did you do it\xe2\x80\xa6 move on with your life I\'m sure it\'s hard without Mal \xe2\x80\xa6"Jay closed his eyes sadly "It\'s hard I\'m not going to lie to you on that\xe2\x80\xa6 but, it takes some time to heal \xe2\x80\xa6 seeing Logan and the kids without their mother would have to be the hardest thing that I have to do\xe2\x80\xa6but, I know I had to be strong for them," he nodded at his kids with a small smile "Mal would\'ve kicked my arse if I was neglecting them when they need their dad\xe2\x80\xa6 and that\'s what I did\xe2\x80\xa6 losing Mal\xe2\x80\xa6 it was really hard\xe2\x80\xa6 but, if I didn\'t have Charlie to help me heal when he did\xe2\x80\xa6 I would\'ve want to kill myself but, I couldn\'t bring myself to do that since I have my kids\xe2\x80\xa6 they would\'ve have anyone except you and Ariel\xe2\x80\xa6 and I couldn\'t do that... I promised Mal that I would take over\xe2\x80\xa6 if one of us were to lose our lives at the war\xe2\x80\xa6 and that\'s when I knew she was right\xe2\x80\xa6 I should be strong for the kids\xe2\x80\xa6 but, at least I\'m not alone... I have my kids\xe2\x80\xa6raising them was hard at first since they were a bit young\xe2\x80\xa6I\'m just glad I didn\'t lose my them\xe2\x80\xa6 yes, it\'s hard but, it\'s totally worth it seeing them smile again\xe2\x80\xa6 It\'s what this family needs nugget," he explained."Maybe\xe2\x80\xa6""Then what\'s the problem nugget?""I think I\'m just scared\xe2\x80\xa6 to go out there\xe2\x80\xa6 without Harry\xe2\x80\xa6""I know it\'s scary but, you still got me and Ariel to help you know\xe2\x80\xa6""I know\xe2\x80\xa6""No, I mean it nugget\xe2\x80\xa6 I know it\'s been horrible for you Merlin knows you been through a lot then we did\xe2\x80\xa6 but, you can always talk to us\xe2\x80\xa6you can\'t keep bottling things up on how you\'re feeling it\'s going to tear you apart babes "Hermione sniffed "I know\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s hard\xe2\x80\xa6""I know it is but, in time it will get better I promise I bet when we get home in Forks\xe2\x80\xa6.you\'ll be able to move on with your life...I guarantee that,""And what about you?""Same with me we\'ll do it together you\'re not alone in this nugget,""Like who? Who would want to go out with me when I have nine children""I think a few\xe2\x80\xa6 there\'s Jacob Black\xe2\x80\xa6 Seth Clearwater\xe2\x80\xa6 anyone really even Leah CLearwater and Sam Uley,""Ugh don\'t even get me started with Samuel while the others are still my best friends even after all these years""Uh oh \xe2\x80\xa6 said his full name\xe2\x80\xa6 what did Sammy boy do this time?""It\'s not what what he do \xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s what he did... from what I heard he\'s now engaged to a girl name Emily.."Jay flinched at this "Ah\xe2\x80\xa6 you heard about that bit huh?""Yeah I did\xe2\x80\xa6""Did Ariel tell you why?""Said that Samuel cheated on Leah with her cousin Emily is that true,"Jay sighed and swore under his breath "Did she now anything else?""She also mentioned that uncle Harry nearly died \xe2\x80\xa6 that year from a heart attack if it wasn\'t for you for saving him\xe2\x80\xa6 when you were living in Forks? Is that true?""It is \xe2\x80\xa6.""And about Isabella messing things up?""That\'s also true too...""Even when she\'s toying and using Jacob\'s feelings like that by trying to get information over the Cullens you should know that I\'m good friends with Dr. Cullen back in St. Mungo\'s before he moved back to America I just didn\'t realize he was living in our home town no less... "Jay sighed at this "Yeah everything you just heard from Ariel are all true\xe2\x80\xa6""And you could\'ve told me that?""You were too busy fighting in the war it wasn\'t exactly pleasant to add in the conversation nugget and besides you would\'ve been distracted and wouldn\'t be able to win the war,""Funny that\'s what Ariel said too\xe2\x80\xa6""Well you could\'ve \xe2\x80\xa6 " Jay began to say turning to Hermione who stared at him with wide eyes "Do you have any idea how hard it was to go back home\xe2\x80\xa6 explain to Sam and the others that you were still in school despite how you weren\'t\xe2\x80\xa6 you were away in a mission no one knew where you guys were... hell neither of us did not even the Weasley\'s\xe2\x80\xa6 the last time they saw you was when you guys were attacked during the reception on Bill and Fleur\'s wedding\xe2\x80\xa6 " he sighed tiredly causing her to be quiet bowing her head "We were bloody worried sick over you nugget\xe2\x80\xa6 it was so hard.. I couldn\'t even concentrate when Mal was pregnant with Logan, Zander, CJ and Sophy\xe2\x80\xa6 because I was too busy worrying over you\xe2\x80\xa6 we both were\xe2\x80\xa6 we didn\'t want you to be the one to kill that bastard by yourself\xe2\x80\xa6 since you guys knew how to kill him\xe2\x80\xa6 none of the spells would work and yet Dumbledore left Harry with a mission that he couldn\'t tell the rest of us\xe2\x80\xa6 we all wanted to kill that bastard\xe2\x80\xa6 especially those death eaters that killed mum and dad that left you to feel guilty after you send them away to Australia only to find out they never made it to Australia by ending up getting killed from a drunk driver in a car crash during the war\xe2\x80\xa6 we\'ve been scared of a half-blood wizard for Merlin knows how long\xe2\x80\xa6 and he wasn\'t just dangerous but, very powerful, a git and prejudice all in one go but, it made most of the Wizarding communities frighten because of it and thanks to you guys we don\'t have to worry about that anymore \xe2\x80\xa6 because we\'re in peace\xe2\x80\xa6 besides the death eaters out there.." he explained."Jay\xe2\x80\xa6""We were so worried nugget why couldn\'t you just tell us that instead of sending us away we couldn\'t help too,""I couldn\'t risk it Jay\xe2\x80\xa6 you were going to be a father\xe2\x80\xa6 I didn\'t want Mal to be by herself worrying over you when she\'s pregnant with the quadruplets \xe2\x80\xa6 it would\'ve been to much fo her\xe2\x80\xa6 you couldn\'t miss their births while worrying over me\xe2\x80\xa6 it would\'ve made me more guilty and worried over the whole thing and we couldn\'t just let him win Jay.. you know that\xe2\x80\xa6 no one in England would know how dangerous we were in war we just couldn\'t let him win...with families scared to death\xe2\x80\xa6""I know\xe2\x80\xa6 I know\xe2\x80\xa6it just sucks that Ariel and I had to back out in the last minute sending us away in Forks is all\xe2\x80\xa6 desite how we were so worried over you""I know and I apologize over that so many times and \xe2\x80\xa6 I just\xe2\x80\xa6" Hermione began to say with a steadying her breath "I\'m sorry for worrying you guys\xe2\x80\xa6 but, what i don\'t understand is why couldn\'t you just tell me the truth\xe2\x80\xa6 I\'m not a little kid anymore\xe2\x80\xa6 I\'m far from being a kid," she explained."You don\'t think I haven\'t noticed you haven\'t been a kid a long time you always been mature for your own age and believe me I wanted to tell you but, dealing with the aftermath of the war\xe2\x80\xa6 it was hard not telling you about it\xe2\x80\xa6 while I was cleaning the messes that Isabella made \xe2\x80\xa6 I figured\xe2\x80\xa6 it would be less of a hassle for you\xe2\x80\xa6 to worry about\xe2\x80\xa6I could\'ve deal with the mess on my own,"Hermione grew quiet "I have to grow up some time Jay\xe2\x80\xa6 but, you should\'ve told me\xe2\x80\xa6 I could\'ve help you I know people all over the country thanks to Jax,""I know you do but, I also have some friends all over the world too you\'re not the only one who made friends around here and I\'m sorry I kept that from you\xe2\x80\xa6. it\'s just a lot to deal with Mia,""Well yes, I suppose dealing with Isabella was a bit \xe2\x80\xa6 dramatic isn\'t it,"Jay snorted "Understatement of the year no doubt believe me. I honestly don\'t think she cares about the consequences when it comes with that stuff""She never did even when we were children,""Yeah no doubt\xe2\x80\xa6 ""And what about Mikko\xe2\x80\xa6 apparently what Ariel told me he\'s dating some bint name Jessica Stanley or something?"Jay gave a \'hum\' sound "Yeah \xe2\x80\xa6 about that\xe2\x80\xa6 they broke up \xe2\x80\xa6 as far as I heard from Aqua \xe2\x80\xa6 but, I\'m not sure anymore\xe2\x80\xa6 I don\'t really pay attention with Mikko it\'s mostly\xe2\x80\xa6 about Isabella since she\'s threaten the magical communities because of it,""Because she\'s dating this Edmund bloke,""Yes she is and he\'s name is Edward not Edmund,"Hermione snorted "Whatever, do you have his file?""I do\xe2\x80\xa6""May I see them?"Jay sighed at this grabbing his backpack grabbing the files "That\'s them right there?" he pointed at the Cullens as they sat down on the table making sure they\'re under a silent charm while watching over their kids inside the arcade as Jay told them they can play another hour."Who\'s who?""That\'s Dr. Cullen he\'s a doctor in town\xe2\x80\xa6"Dr. Cullen\xe2\x80\xa6 I know him?""How?""He was also the doctor that helped in St. Mungos\' five years ago\xe2\x80\xa6 "Jay paled at this "Was he?""Yes he\'s very helpful \xe2\x80\xa6 we still keep in touch through owls\xe2\x80\xa6 but, he failed to tell me that he was living in Forks though... ""Oh\xe2\x80\xa6""Yeah but, he\'s a pretty decent bloke though\xe2\x80\xa6 so I don\'t really have a problem with him,""Me either he\'s a good guy\xe2\x80\xa6 have you ever met his wife? Esme Cullen?""No I never did\xe2\x80\xa6 but, I think Luna did\xe2\x80\xa6 but, I\'m not completely sure\xe2\x80\xa6""Luna\xe2\x80\xa6" Jay winced at this "Draco isn\'t going to like that?""Why not?""Despite how they\'re animal drinkers you know how Draco overprotective with his wife and family right?""Yeah I know ...we both are,""Exactly but, then again I did met his wife Esme once or twice\xe2\x80\xa6 she\'s pretty nice\xe2\x80\xa6 she\'s like a mother hen in her \xe2\x80\xa6 family\xe2\x80\xa6""What about the adopted kids?""Hm\xe2\x80\xa6 from what I read from the files\xe2\x80\xa6 Edward was turned first\xe2\x80\xa6 " Jay drifted off noticing his sister Hermione reading the files "Nugget\xe2\x80\xa6 do you know how that is?" he asked."I assume that\'s Edward\xe2\x80\xa6 Edward Cullen\xe2\x80\xa6 Ariel gave me his file\xe2\x80\xa6 he\'s a \xe2\x80\xa6 telepathy read people\'s thoughts without their consent right?""Yes\xe2\x80\xa6 a bit annoying really\xe2\x80\xa6 and he\'s also dating our dimwitted cousin,""I heard\xe2\x80\xa6 are you sure it\'s not \xe2\x80\xa6""No, it\'s not Cedric\xe2\x80\xa6 that\'s Edward?"Hermione paled at this "Are you sure\xe2\x80\xa6""I\'m quite positive I got Aqua to double check since that\'s her dead fianc\xc3\xa9e before he got murdered by that monster," Jay murmured."Right\xe2\x80\xa6 so uh ...how long they been dating for?""Since they met\xe2\x80\xa6 nearly 2 years now \xe2\x80\xa6it took maybe a few weeks before Edward\xe2\x80\xa6 decided to announce their relationship\xe2\x80\xa6so\xe2\x80\xa6but, during my time staying there in Forks-it was before Isabella arrived in town\xe2\x80\xa6 I didn\'t socialize a lot of people except the ones in La Push but, from uncle Charlie told me apparently Edward and his siblings don\'t cause any trouble he thought at first they would but, they\'re nothing like any vampires I ever \xe2\x80\xa6 met before until I came to visit them last summer apparently that\'s when Edward and our dimwitted cousin broke up \xe2\x80\xa6 during their junior year before they got back together by the end of the year\xe2\x80\xa6" Jay explained."I heard about that... apparently she\'s starting to be a rebel when they broke up\xe2\x80\xa6 during their junior year\xe2\x80\xa6 from what Ariel told me," Hermione murmured.Jay snorted "More like trying to see Edward in her hallucination imagination or whatever that could\'ve got her killed is an understatement but, she did cause a lot of trouble not going to lie on that nearly gave uncle Charlie a heart attack,""I can imagine and her\xe2\x80\xa6 the pixie girl?""That\'s Alice Cullen she can see the future?"Hermione scoffed "The future\xe2\x80\xa6 that\'s barbaric\xe2\x80\xa6 really \xe2\x80\xa6 a physic\xe2\x80\xa6 since Ariel told me she doesn\'t get along with her too cheery for her taste being Isabella\'s best friend," she explained."I know it\'s hard to believe but, with Alice visions they\'re all legits.. everything she had a vision it came true,"~*~End of Chapter Twelve~*~Wow that was the longest chapter I wrote last night and yet it\'s the beginning of a new journey for Hermione and her friends and I know there\'s a lot of questions either or not I\'ll update or not which I\'m not giving up on this story since I planned on writing a long story with loads of chapters so this is just the beginning on what I\'m writing and don\'t hesitate to leave a review or two. Ciao for now dolls!\nChapter Thirteen: Distracting Hermione (Part 2)"Do you actually believe her visions are really true?"Jay held his breath "Honestly\xe2\x80\xa6 you want to the truth?""Yes\xe2\x80\xa6 for once I want the truth,""Yeah I really do nugget because her visions are actually legit\xe2\x80\xa6 if it wasn\'t for her\xe2\x80\xa6 she wouldn\'t know about the Volturi arrival in Forks and everything\xe2\x80\xa6 including the battle with Victoria and her army...if it wasn\'t for me and my recruits back in America they would\'ve been dead\xe2\x80\xa6 she killed over 2,550 people but, the ones who the Cullens and the Quileute pack killed was only 200 people while we killed the rest 2,350 newborns vampires thanks to us we didn\'t leave anything out""So they already \xe2\x80\xa6 killed Victoria and her newborns vampire then huh?""Yes we did,""When?""Last winter\xe2\x80\xa6 I assume\xe2\x80\xa6""And what about him\xe2\x80\xa6 Jasper\xe2\x80\xa6?

What should I put on the cake?""Happy Birthday Harry," Hermione explained."And uncle Neville since it\'s his birthday too," Teddy quickly added."Oh right and Neville my friend too it\'s both their birthdays actually," Hermione explained."How old are they going to be and do you want one big size cake for them both?" Josh asked."25 years old and yes please cookie dough it\'s their favorite," Hermione murmured; a small lie she didn\'t really have any reason to give out her late husband real age to a stranger now did she."Wow tell your husband and your friend happy birthday for me," Josh replied."Of course, and can you put in the bottom from his wife Hermione and the kids,""Kids\xe2\x80\xa6" Josh weakly says."Yes, my children\xe2\x80\x94" Hermione looked at my children "We have nine children together,"Josh nearly choke his drink "Nine children," he weakly says."Yes, is that a problem?" Hermione asked raising her eyebrow with a glower an icy cold look revealing her wedding ring."N-n-n-no ma \'me of course not," Josh weakly says, it didn\'t stop Hermione giving him a glower look "Um\xe2\x80\xa6 that would be $40.00 altogether ma \'me,""Here you go," Hermione murmured giving her credit card.Josh swiped her card "Hermione Potter here\'s your receipt just write your name and thank you for picking Ben and Jerry\'s hope we see you soon and have a great day ma \'me,"Hermione gave a \'hmmm\' nod "Thank you \xe2\x80\xa6 " she murmured writing her signature and everyone took their orders heading outside."What was that about momma?" Rosie murmured eating her ice cream which was one of the banana split ice cream.Hermione shrugged "Must\'ve have a crush on me luv,"Rose scrunched her nose "Ewe, he\'s not even that cute mama? Uncle Harry was better," she says causing Hermione to laugh at this as she held her baby girl Rose."Always was luv since he\'s my husband and your godfather lovely," Hermione winked at her goddaughter while Rose giggled nodding at this as they headed to the park before heading home "Jay what time is it?" she asked."About 6:15 it\'s a little early to head home but, why don\'t we look around the mall since it\'s still early," Jay offered.Hermione gave a smile "Should we look around the mall since the mall doesn\'t close till 9 wouldn\'t it?" she asked."They usually do \xe2\x80\xa6 see what they have besides clothes and such" Jay offered."Sounds like a plan come on kids hold onto us closely," Hermione murmured as everyone held hands and apparate to the west side of the mall making sure no one didn\'t see them disappear.Back in the Number 12 Grimmauld Place everyone was setting up for the farewell party. Ariel, Pansy and Luna were preparing everything making sure it was set up."How\'s your end Cissa, Lucius, Andie?" Pansy asked peeking through the living room."Done, everything\'s set sweetheart," Narcissa announced beaming at this.Pansy grinned "Brilliant, how about your side boys? Mya should be here soon along with Jay and the children," she explained."We\'re almost set\xe2\x80\x94" Theo announced rubbing his hands with a bit adjustments "And \xe2\x80\xa6 done what do you think babe?" setting the banner \'Happy Birthday Harry & Neville\' which left everyone teared up "You think he would\'ve love this if he was here\xe2\x80\xa6" he murmured.Pansy wobbled over to her husband "I think he would\'ve loved everything Theo," she murmured."Now come on guys we can\'t be crying this was supposed to be a good thing not the \xe2\x80\xa6oh never mind," Ariel sighed feeling her hormones are all over the place "Georgie," she whimpered.George rushed over his wife "What\'s wrong?" he asked alarmed "Is it the kids?""No, no, it\'s not the kids," Ariel sniffed "I wish there was something we can do to help Mya," she whispered.George soften his eyes hugging his wife "I know babe I know," he murmured giving Fred a sad look which he also felt saddened over his adopted brother Harry."Do you think he would\'ve want Mia to be happy\xe2\x80\xa6." Ariel murmured."I\'m pretty sure he would\xe2\x80\xa6 just like the rest of our friends would," Lucius murmured giving a hand squeeze over Ariel\'s shoulder."Thank you, Mr. Malfoy," Ariel murmured."I told you to call me Lucius, despite everything I really am sorry that I couldn\'t help your sister at the war in behalf of my family...," Lucius whispered."I know\xe2\x80\xa6.and thank you, Lucius\xe2\x80\xa6" Ariel whispered."Of course," Lucius nodded at this "Now then how\'s the food coming along?" he asked."The food is now served we just have to set up the dinner table and we\'d be good to go,""Guys! I just got word that Jay, Mya and the kids should be here within 45 minutes less talking more preparing," Luna snapped being 7 \xc2\xbd months pregnant\xe2\x80\x94pregnant hormones causing everyone to move quickly since the party is about to start soon "Draco will you be a luv and buy me some potato chips I\'m craving for them please," she pouts.Draco sighed setting the chips on the table "Well, It\'s a good thing I got all kinds of chips knowing you would be craving for these luv\'s," he grinned causing Luna to perk up grabbing the chips "Especially at the party," he explained."Gimme," Luna snapped snatching the bag out of Draco\'s hands while he shivered at this."Bloody Salazar\xe2\x80\xa6 just two more months\xe2\x80\xa6 "Draco muttered under his breath "Until baby Penny gets here \xe2\x80\xa6 just two more bloody months,""I heard that," Luna snapped at this causing Draco, Neville and Blaise to sigh at this knowing the pregnancy hormones are getting to Luna."I\'ll be outside\xe2\x80\xa6" Draco murmured dragging Blaise with him "Oh and Nev?""Yeah?""Happy Birthday," Draco smirked causing Neville to chuckle "You didn\'t think I\'d forget did you?""No but, thanks Drake I appreciate that," Neville began to say who caught his birthday present noticing they were leaving him by himself "Wait, where are you guys going don\'t leave me," he panicked causing Luna and Pansy to drag poor Neville inside the living room to decorate."Come on don\'t be such a baby Nev I need your help here," Theo announced causing Neville to sigh at this not realizing that their old friend was at the backyard "And happy birthday mate,""Thanks Theo," Neville murmured as everyone bid \'happy birthday\' to Nev who returned the gesture \'thank you,\' as they continued to decorate the living room.In the other side of the Number 12 Grimmauld Place, the backyard where a shadow revealing Harry was waiting for his friends who knew about his secret; they\'re the only ones who knew and now\xe2\x80\xa6 Teddy, Sophia, Hannah and Aria with the kids; he hoped he can count on Teddy, Sophy, Hannah and Aria not to say anything\xe2\x80\xa6 he didn\'t know who else to trust besides his family especially at his situation."Dray why are you\xe2\x80\x94" Blaise was cut off by seeing someone in the shadows with a sigh "Ah\xe2\x80\xa6 now I know why you dragged me here," he murmured."Are you guys by yourself?" Harry muffled hiding behind the shadows "I need to talk to you,""Potter didn\'t we just tell you not to come out yet it\'s too dangerous?" Draco scolded him."Oh, I\'m Potter now that\'s just plain cruel Draco," Harry pouted at this causing Draco to roll his eyes."You know what I mean if Luna and the others were to find out that we kept this secret for nearly\xe2\x80\x94" Draco hissed at him putting a silence charm gesturing him to follow him and Blaise inside the treehouse that they made for the kids "For nearly 3 \xc2\xbd years they\'ll kill us," he dramatically cried out."You don\'t think I haven\'t tried to contact with Mione," Harry cried out in anger "And I know they will but, at least you get to see your family\xe2\x80\xa6 while I can\'t even get close to my own wife and kids when I\'m in this form Draco," he huffed at this."Guys?!" Blaise intervened between his two friends "Calm down \xe2\x80\xa6 we can\'t have anyone find out that we know you\'re alive Harry," he argued in hissed tones.Harry and Draco both sighed at this apology to each other "It wouldn\'t matter anyway\xe2\x80\xa6 since I saw her\xe2\x80\xa6" Harry sadly says."Who?" Draco asked."Mione\xe2\x80\xa6" Harry kicked the floor pouting very sadly "Apparently my powers are growing \xe2\x80\xa6 projecting from one place to another today\xe2\x80\xa6 first I was at the burial where I was buried with the Weasley\'s\xe2\x80\xa6 then went to the zoo\xe2\x80\xa6 and then the mall\xe2\x80\xa6 where Hermione, Jay and the kids were\xe2\x80\xa6apparently we\'re connected somehow... I was so close Drake\xe2\x80\xa6 but, so far away\xe2\x80\xa6 Merlin help me she\'s beautiful\xe2\x80\xa6 so beautiful\xe2\x80\xa6 as always\xe2\x80\xa6but, she looks so sad\xe2\x80\xa6 even for a small minute\xe2\x80\xa6.how is she?" he began to say turning to Draco and Blaise who had wary worried looks which Harry noticed "What? What is it?" he explained."She hasn\'t been the same since you \xe2\x80\xa6 \'died\' \xe2\x80\xa6 she\'s been \xe2\x80\xa6 like an empty shell it took a huge toll out of Mya and the press is being pretty restless following her every move it\'s taking out the energy out of her," Draco explained.Harry sighed at this "I had a feeling this would happen\xe2\x80\xa6 after what happen to the war\xe2\x80\xa6bloody hell the damn reporters" he whispered."It doesn\'t even help that Rita Skeeter seems to find out where you guys are\xe2\x80\xa6 but, luckily they don\'t know the location \xe2\x80\xa6 of where you guys live\xe2\x80\xa6" Draco shrugged at this "I made sure of that," he explained."Oh, and we\'re leaving England in Friday," Blaise asked."YOUR WHAT?!" Harry exclaimed turning to his friends "I thought you guys were leaving next week not this Friday what happen?""Nothing happen per say\xe2\x80\xa6 except Mya can\'t take it anymore after what happen to you, Ron and the rest of the Weasley\'s family \xe2\x80\xa6 being the last of the \'Golden Trio\' especially the reporters been pretty bad asking for a private interview\xe2\x80\xa6 they\'ve been extra restless that they even tried to bother Ariel and Jay at their job which it\'s causing a lot of stress for both parties and it\'s taking a huge toll out of Mya\xe2\x80\xa6" Blaise explained worriedly over his adopted sister.Harry frowned at this "I didn\'t realize it was that bad\xe2\x80\xa6" he began to say which they grew quiet "How bad was it\xe2\x80\xa6 when you last saw her?""We saw her last Sunday when we came to visit her to confirm our plan for Friday within the last minute apparently Lulu got a vision that this would happen which is why we packed early before we even left\xe2\x80\xa6 and on how she looked\xe2\x80\xa6 she was \xe2\x80\xa6 pale\xe2\x80\xa6 a bit worried that the reporters would find out that we\'re leaving which is why Mya insisted we leave a week early at least that\'s what Lulu confirmed anyway causing us to leave a week early in Friday," Draco began to say bitterly "Although if I\'m being honest here Harry\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s a bit bad\xe2\x80\xa6 but, we\'re hanging in there\xe2\x80\xa6at least for now\xe2\x80\xa6 " he then was cut off as he felt the wards coming recognizing his wife Luna\'s magic "Bloody hell we have to go Potter\xe2\x80\xa6 look we\'ll-we\'ll figure out how to hatch you early just wait a little longer huh?" he explained assuring him."That\'s what you said last time Draco how long do I have to wait this time," Harry sighed at this "I\'m starting to think that whatever creature inheritance I turned into is taking it\'s sweet time\xe2\x80\xa6 and I don\'t know \xe2\x80\xa6 how long I can wait Draco\xe2\x80\xa6 I want to see my family again\xe2\x80\xa6 I want to see my wife\xe2\x80\xa6.I miss them so much," he explained sadly."I know but, we\'re finding every book we can think of to figure this out after learning the habitat you are living near you said it was near water right?""Fire and water Draco,""Right.. Okay there\'s a few places I can think of but, it\'s the only plan we got Harry we\'ll see you soon,"Harry sighed "Fine\xe2\x80\xa6 but, can you get some food I\'m bloody starving,""Yeah, we\'re planning on it once we figure out how to get you out of that egg,""Okay\xe2\x80\xa6.and when will I get to see Mia and the kids again?""I can\'t say for sure but, soon Harry\xe2\x80\xa6 you\'ll see your family again,"Harry gave a sad smile "I hope so... I\'m counting on you guys to help me\xe2\x80\xa6" he whispered as he disappeared."I know and we will help you\xe2\x80\xa6we\'ll see you soon Harry\xe2\x80\xa6." Blaise sighed as they watched their friend disappear once again as he turned to Draco "They\'re going to kill us Dray but, not as much as Mya is," he explained."Trust me I know\xe2\x80\xa6 but, we\'ll talk about it later huh?" Draco murmured as they rushed over to the meet up with their families.Jay\'s P.O.V.In the other side of the mall Jay, Hermione and the kids are at the Ben & Jerry\'s eating their ice cream where Jay felt his phone vibrate meaning Ariel\'s probably texting me."Hey, where are you?" Ariel murmured."Mya and I are with the kids are at the mall walking around we just bought some ice cream, so we should be there soon,""Really what time did the zoo close?""Around 6 but, Mya and I with the kids saw all the animals it didn\'t take very long and left around 2:45 pm then went to the park and went to the mall for a bit\xe2\x80\x94we only been in the mall for about two hours and thirty minutes but, I managed to convince Mya to let the kids play at the arcade for a bit for another hour how are things at your end?""Pretty well Tonks managed to make some cookies, cupcakes, scones, and there\'s some apple pie, blueberry pie, chocolate mud pie, yum it\'s making me crave for some dessert now,""Sounds brilliant I can\'t wait to eat when we get back for the party," Jay nodded at this looking at the watch texting her back "Red, we should be back in half an hour since it\'s 6:20 p.m. since it\'s nearly getting dark soon Mya just went to the bathroom really quick and we should be heading back home,""Perfect and once she\'s done with the bathroom you guys can head back home since the party starts at 7 pm sharp since we have to take the ones that we\'re going to leave behind to the bank and head to the airport afterwards including the transfer burials we had to sign a few forms for that,""That is true," I sighed at this then heard my phone vibrate from Ariel calling."Hello?""Hey, just wanted to check on you? How\'s Mia doing?""She seems to be a little better today. She told me she went to visit Harry and the others this morning after I told her the kids and I went to visit Mal and Sophia?"Ariel held her breath "Yeah she told me about that it was a bit hard\xe2\x80\xa6 she also said that Evie saw someone in the cemetery,"Jay got up alerted "You heard about that too\xe2\x80\xa6 so I assume you also \xe2\x80\xa6 heard that there\'s no body in Harry\'s casket,""What? No she failed to mentioned that what do you mean there\'s no body?""I wish I knew\xe2\x80\xa6 what did you hear from Mia?""Hermione told me she said Evie saw Harry which is impossible\xe2\x80\xa6 so she just said that it was probably Harry\'s spirit or something\xe2\x80\xa6 but, she\'s still cautious about the whole thing,""No wonder she looked pale \xe2\x80\xa6" I murmured."What?""Nothing\xe2\x80\xa6 listen Mya is on her way we should be leaving say 10 minutes would that be enough time for you guys to go hide and all that,""That\'s too early Jay ... just keep distracting her since it\'s barley 6:30 since it\'s still early to come back,""What am I supposed to do for the next half hour?""I don\'t know ... oh wait I know go to the book store it would keep her occupied for the next half hour and she can buy more books for us,""More books... right, right okay I\'ll be sure to do that there\'s actually a bookstore that I been wanting to get anyway."Perfect, just be sure to keep Mya occupied at least half an hour because Draco and Blaise should get the cake they\'re setting it up""Cake but, Hermione bought ice cream cake though\xe2\x80\xa6 although it was for Harry and Neville\xe2\x80\xa6and we also ate cake for dessert at the zoo it was Hannah\'s idea it seemed to help a little bit""She did? She didn\'t have to do that\xe2\x80\xa6?""Yeah... but, I think she might be visiting him tomorrow before we leave to the airport before we transfer everyone to Forks,"Ariel gave a \'hum\' sound "Probably oh shoot Draco and Blaise are here, just keep distracting her until it reaches 7 and I\'ll see you guys within half an hour Jay,""See you,""Hey," Hermione greeted me gathering our things together inside her beaded bag "Who were you talking too?""Just one of my friends in Forks\xe2\x80\xa6he\'s been watching over the house since Mal and I decided to live in England years ago and wanted to let me know that he fixed up the house and everything," I lied.Hermione stared at me with a raise eyebrow "Oh really who?""Tai," I lied at this."Really how was it and speaking of Tai. I need to talk to him about something,""About what?""You remember how you own the school and everything being the big boss?""Yeah\xe2\x80\xa6""Well I was thinking only if your okay with it that I\'d be the head principal on both Forks High and LaPush High while you and Ariel be the co-assistant principles, we\'ll be working in the shadows. I even asked Tai to help me with it,""You want to be the head principe I thought you wanted to be in school,""I was but, I\'m way over high school I rather just be a teacher\xe2\x80\xa6 and be the head principle,""So you\'re going to be a teacher and a head principle,""Yes\xe2\x80\xa6 "Jay nodded with a thoughtful nod with a grin "Brilliant I had a feeling you\'d say that what do you want us to do?""Well I already got Draco, Luna, Neville, Blaise, Pansy and Theo to be the teachers in the school, Fred and George will work and I got a few ideas for the school?""Like what?"Hermione grinned grabbing her binder full of plans which Jay had to blink his eyes owlish on how big the binder was "What\'s this?""My plans for the town?""What sort of plans are you planning nugget?""Do you remember how you said that LaPush High was under construction?""Yeah\xe2\x80\xa6""I decided to extend the opening for another year,""Another year? For what?""I figured we can compromise this Jay. I decided to build new classrooms in both high schools and add new teacher staff in both schools,""Like who it\'s going to take weeks before we can hire people,""Oh don\'t worry Draco and the others are going to portray both teachers in both schools and I\'m also planning on building a magical school for magical and non magical students within our property,""Really?""Yes,""And who exactly is going to be the head principle in this magical school,""I am?\'"That\'s three schools nugget,""I know but, the Black Pearl of Magic Academy i\'m still working on the name isn\'t going to open within 2 years from now and I decided to portray as a student, as a disguise while being the head principle, the mysterious boss while being a teacher,""Really\xe2\x80\xa6?""Yes,""Which classes?""English, Math, History, P.E. Music, Dancing, Journalism, and being the boss in both schools,""That\'s a lot nugget,""Eh nothing I can\'t handle\xe2\x80\xa6 besides\xe2\x80\xa6 most of those classes are with Isabella\xe2\x80\xa6 so she won\'t be able to see this coming,"Jay however, realize what she\'s doing "Oh I get it you want to make Isabella\'s life turned upside down by portraying as a student, when you\'re really the teacher and the head principle. Sneaky and cunning that\'s very Slytherin of you,"Hermione grinned with a shrug "I know and not even the Cullens is going to expect this either I\'m also going to be their teacher too and I also changed everything in the school," she explained."What do you mean?""Instead of the school starting at 8:10 in the morning it\'s going to start 7:30 in the morning and ends at 5:00 in the evening and the classes will be 8 classes not 6 and it won\'t be starting in September 5th,""Then when will it start if not September 5th?""August 25th 2011,"Jay chuckled "Sneaky\xe2\x80\xa6.very sneaky,""Why thank you so what do you think?""I love it\xe2\x80\xa6 count me in and I\'m pretty sure Ariel would love to help too. You do know our cousin Isabella is with our estrange aunt Renee in Florida right with Edward,""Yes I realize that but, she won\'t be getting the memo...she or the Cullen family-the only ones who will find out will be Jasper\xe2\x80\xa6 I\'m going to befriend him first then he\'ll be able to send the message 3 days later since August 25th is in Wednesday so we have a lot of time in our hands before they arrive,""Has anyone ever told you that your bloody brilliant Mya,""Yes, yes they have so are you in?""Oh I am so in and did you manage to talk to Tai about this since he lives there,""He does?""Yeah he uh moved to Forks about 2 \xc2\xbd years ago,""Oh really... Tai what?""Nugget it\'s one of my friends from \xe2\x80\xa6 my old boarding school\xe2\x80\xa6 Taichi Kamiya you remember him, don\'t you?""Really I didn\'t know Tai was living in Forks?""Yeah\xe2\x80\xa6he uh moved to Forks about 2 years ago with his family he married to Mimi and has children about the same amount as I do and he works in both schools thanks to me,""Eight children and really that\'s perfect since I need his help with this?""Well yeah he always wanted a big family and well there you go\xe2\x80\xa6and I\'m sure he\'ll be happy to help,""Brilliant," Hermione grinned writing a note and whistled where an owl came down "Hey boy\xe2\x80\xa6 can you do me a favor and give this to Tai Kamiya he lives in Forks, Washington," she murmured.The owl hooted happily after Hermione gave him an owl treat, grabbed the letter and headed to America hopefully the plans are in motion."Well it\'s official we\'re now the co-owners of the schools right,""Absolutely and uncle Charlie already knows since he approves he\'s excited to see the look on Edward\'s face. He really hates him,""I know he does the feeling is mutual,""Of course so uh, where exactly did you and Mal move too in Forks anyway Ariel never did explain that bit?""It was in the reservation in La Push not to far from the first beach apparently,""Really," Hermione looked surprised "That\'s even more brilliant because the manor that we\'re going to be living in too is near the beach too,""Really what was the manor called again Mya?""The Black Pearl apparently Sirius used to live there when he was on the run that time\xe2\x80\x94" Hermione drifted off with a distant look "I wish I could\'ve help him more than Harry would\'ve stayed with him\xe2\x80\xa6" she whispered.I gave her a hand squeeze "You did all you could do babe,""I know\xe2\x80\xa6 I just \xe2\x80\xa6 I wish it was enough," Hermione whispered."You can\'t always save them all Mya I know you want to help but, it is what it is." I murmured."I know\xe2\x80\xa6" Hermione murmured leaning her head against her brother Jay as he put his arm around his sister looking at the time and called over Logan with the boys as it was time to head home and threw their trash away.By then James, Seth, Lily, Evie and Henry woke up from their nap as they were sleeping in their stroller while Teddy helped to push the stroller, then in the other stroller was Rose, Daisy, Amelia and Hugo who was pushed by Jay and then there\'s the oldest kids\xe2\x80\x94Logan, Zander, CJ, Sophia, Newton, Nelson, Arianna and Hannah walking with their dad and aunt.Jay remembered what he promised Ariel to distract their little sister for another half hour before the party "Oh speaking of ... we still got half an hour left let\'s uh look around the mall some more?""But, I got enough books for our trip though?""Yes I realize that but, I saw a book store not far from here?""A book store where?"Jay scanned around the mini mall "There," he pointed at the store "Barnes and Noble let\'s check it out I bet your dying to get another book,"Hermione flushed "Well... I do need a new book to keep me occupied over the flight since I read my other books more than once," she murmured."Exactly let\'s check it out how about it?""Okay we\'ll get another book no later than half an hour,""I\'m not the one who has a huge collection of books in her bedroom,"Hermione flushed "Prat," she playfully hits her brother Jay on the shoulder as they headed inside Barnes and Noble book store "Wow... there\'s so many books..." she bit her bottom lip nervously "I shouldn\'t.. I already have all my books back home," she explained."So we can get another book shelf for the new set of books it\'s not a crime to buy more you know," Jay grinned wiggling his eyebrows "Shall we?"Hermione grinned "We shall," she explained as they scanned around the bookstore."Momma can we get a new book too?" Evie asked."Of course luv come on," Hermione began to say gathering the kids out of their strollers as they went to the kid\'s section "We can buy as many books as you want luvs," she explained."Goodie," Evie and Lily giggled as they looked around the bookstore "Momma can we get this one?" they both asked.Hermione looked at the kids section "I\'m sure this book seems ... reasonable... we should buy more books lovelies... come on I\'m sure there\'s more books to look huh?" she explained."Yeah," Evie, Lily, James, Henry and Seth explained."Momma Minnie can we get this one?" Rose asked."What\'s this about Rosie?" Hermione asked."Umm.. about a wolf,""A wolf?""Uh huh can I get it pleaseeee,"Hermione sighed at this looking at the back to look at the price which was a decent good price "Alright Rosie you can get this one,""Really?""Mhmm is that all you want?""Can I get another book?""How many books do you want?""Umm-" Amelia began to say scanning around the bookstore "That one," she explained.Hermione blinked her eyes owlish staring at the stuff animals "Another toy?" she asked."Uh huh...""You want another toy?""Yes,"Hermione sighed "You have enough toys Nia?""I know but, I really, really, really want this one and it\'s not for me it\'s for uncle grandpa Charlie?""Oh I see so it\'s not for you it\'s for your uncle grandpa Charlie I bet he\'d love this present,""Really you think so momma?""Mhmm why the hell not... put it inside the cart huh while we get more books for you kids and now it\'s my turn to buy some books for our travels huh?""Okay,"Hermione scanned around the bookstore and saw a series of Game of Thrones "Hmm... this looks interesting why the hell not," she shrugged at this putting the book set inside the cart then looked around "Maybe I can find some ideas for my book," she murmured."Hey auntie Minnie look I found a book that you might like?" Logan asked.Hermione looked at the book \'Harry Potter\' the book series it made her curious "Oh really...it says Harry Potter and the Philosopher\'s Stone...interesting..." she began to say scanning the book it\'s similar to the adventures that she went too with her late husband Harry and their best friend Ron "How in Merlin did they know about that.." she explained looking at the book set."Did it help auntie Minnie?" CJ asked."Oh yes.. yes it did... come on let\'s go look some more huh?""Okay,""Auntie Minnie can I get this one?" Sophia asked.Hermione blinked her eyes owlish looking at the book "Sophy where did you get this book?" she murmured."Over there..." Sophia asked pointing at the Adult section."Hmm... umm well... you\'re a little young to read this kind of books maybe try that aisle over there it has werewolves," Hermione winked playfully causing Sophia to perk up pointing at the other aisle "And you should ask your dad about it," she explained."Okay," Sophia nodded at this biting her bottom lip debating what book to get which is a huge pile "Auntie Minnie do you think daddy would let me get this many books?" she murmured.Hermione giggled "I\'m pretty sure he\'ll be fine with it as long as it\'s not rated M type of books since you\'re still a little young for that," she explained."Awe how old do I have to be to read those books?""Older way, way, way older,"Sophia pouted "Can\'t I read your pile of books auntie Minnie?" she asked."You really like to read books huh and of course you can?"Sophia nodded at this "Oh yes, you been reading bedtime stories ever since I was little and I guess I must\'ve inherited reading books from you auntie Minnie,"Hermione giggled kissing her goddaughter on the forehead "Come on let\'s find your father and your brothers so we can head home," she explained."Okay," Sophia replied as they found Jay with the boys-Logan, Zander, CJ, Teddy, Newton and Nelson with their piles of books.After a few minutes they finally got enough books to last them a lifetime, Hermione however got the Harry Potter book set and decided to buy it being the curious person she wanted to read a new adventure with piles of books from her children, her nieces and nephews."You guys ready to go?" Hermione began to say looking around for Jay and the boys "Where\'s the others and your father?" she explained."Dad is at the check out there\'s a long line so it might be awhile and yeah we\'re ready to go," Logan explained."Good we should get going since it\'s almost 7 I don\'t want to go home late," Hermione began to say as they gathered their books where Jay was waiting with his set of books who was in line staring at the pile of books he had in his cart "There you are where have you been?""Around\xe2\x80\xa6I was downstairs found some travel books for us to do and other books " Jay began to say with a shrug noticing his sister raise eyebrow "What?""Travel books?""Yeah I thought since we\'re going to live in America we might as well find some spots for us to do like go to Disneyland for the kids,"Hermione lips twitched "I already planned that trip for us to go,""You did?\'"Mhmm?""For who?""For the kids\xe2\x80\xa6 James, Seth, Lily, Evie, Henry, Rose, Daisy, Amelia and Hugo for their birthday I got everything booked for us and stay in a hotel for the week,""A week in Disneyland,""Yep,""Bloody hell you thought of this ahead of time didn\'t you?""Yeah I did I want my kids to experience the muggle world as we did in their age,"Jay gave his sister a hug "I bet they would\'ve loved that did you buy all the tickets for us,""I did I called in advance and I got VIP passes for us,""VIP passes for all of us,""Yep,""Bloody hell\xe2\x80\xa6" Jay whistled at this "You didn\'t have to do that I could\'ve bought our tickets too," he pointed out."I know but, I been planning their surprise for awhile\xe2\x80\xa6 and I figured we can celebrate it together since we\'re going to live in America so why the hell not\xe2\x80\xa6" Hermione shrugged at this "And I have enough money to last me a lifetime\xe2\x80\xa6I\'m not going to spend a lot but, enough for my family to have the best childhood they ever had," she explained."Thank you Mia you really didn\'t have to do that," Jay pointed out."I know but, I want too besides\xe2\x80\xa6 my travel agent Elena gave me the details about the whole thing so I got everything planned for us to do during our stay in Forks so I might as well plan something for us to do together as a family," Hermione began to say noticing the books inside the cart "Is that all your books Jay?" she explained."Yeah and I got some board games a bit expensive but, I figured I can teach the kids some games besides Quidditch ya know including Logan\'s, Zander\'s, CJ\'s, Newt\'s, Nelson\'s and Teddy\'s apparently got some books too?""And I thought you didn\'t like to read?""I don\'t usually but, what else am I supposed to do for the next 11 hours flight in Friday?""You could sleep?""True\xe2\x80\xa6 but, I rather keep myself occupied have a lot of work to do,""Sounds fair,""Is that your piles of books?""Just this pile the rest are our children\'s books?"Jay gawked at the pile of books inside the cart "That\'s a lot of books Mia?""Not my fault they like to read books Jay,""What\'s this book about?""Don\'t know but, it\'s called the Game of Thrones it looks interesting and look they have books of Harry\xe2\x80\xa6 too?""What?""The Harry Potter series imagine that\xe2\x80\xa6.it even has pacific details over it\xe2\x80\xa6 even the troll.. Incident\xe2\x80\xa6""You\'re kidding,""Nope\xe2\x80\xa6""And this book?""Sophy likes the werewolves can\'t deny that to your little girl can you?""You\'re a very, very bad influence over my kids,""Oh ha, ha, ha,""I\'m kidding now come on let\'s check these out and head home huh?""Sounds good," Hermione answered.After they check out the books, Hermione put everything inside her beaded bag to carry them to the house so they wouldn\'t have to carry a lot, set her children inside their stroller but, they rushed wanting to be near their mother. It took some getting used too but, eventually Hermione got used to carrying her kids as if she\'s a natural mother and continued shopping until it was time to get home since it was starting to get late and packed their stuff; they split up to carry the kids.Hermione and Teddy both carried James and Henry while Jay carried Daisy and Amelia, then Newton carried Henry, Arianna carried Rose, Nelson carried Hugo, then CJ carried Seth despite how they could\'ve used the stroller but, it was a lot of kids; they all apparate holding the kids closely with a \'stuck-me\' charm inside their baby pouches however Logan, Zander, Sophia, Arianna and Hanna did a side-along with their dad Jay who held them close not wanting to lose each other and stepped inside the Manor Number 12 Grimmauld Place by dusting herself seeing Ariel did a signal to their brother Jay who winked at them as he couldn\'t wait til their sister Hermione to see the party."Hmm.. I wonder where everyone went\xe2\x80\xa6 Tonks told me that she\'ll be back with Remus from the bank?""The bank for what?\'"She didn\'t say she just said she needed to go to the bank\xe2\x80\xa6 huh weird\xe2\x80\xa6" Hermione scanned around furrowing her eyebrows glancing around "Maybe they\'re not home yet...I\'ll turn on the light," she explained.However, Hermione didn\'t noticed that Jay also hide behind the shadows "Jay\xe2\x80\xa6 where are you?"[no answer]..."Jay\xe2\x80\xa6""I\'m in here Mia\xe2\x80\xa6in the living room," Jay answered in the background.Ariel also gave another signal to Jay who nodded whispering to the kids who nodded at this sneaking behind to hide not wanting them to get hurt despite how the Manor was gloomy and glum there\'s usually a loud and rowdy, filled with noise from everyone. The minute they arrived it was quiet enough to hear a pin drop and not a person in sight.Hermione drew her wand and held her trusty beaded bag close. Hexes and Jinxes ran through her mind as she slowly made her way through the kitchen and towards the living room; her senses alert that she didn\'t noticed that Jay took the kids where the others were hiding to prepare themselves to surprise her.The minute Hermione turned on the light and then\xe2\x80\x94 "SURPRISE?!" several people jumped out of their hiding places and shouted in unison causing Hermione to shriek and run back into the kitchen her face was beat red. Everyone erupted into laughter, causing her face to only go redder, she quietly berated herself for getting so scared of a surprise party. The war was over after all nothing left to be afraid of\xe2\x80\xa6 well except the death eaters but, that\'s a different manner. She made her way to the living room, a smile on her lips shaking her head."Guys you didn\'t have to do all this," Hermione lips twitched looking at Luna and Pansy looking smug "I thought I told you guys no parties," she scolded her friends playfully."And miss having a party of a lifetime not likely Mya," Pansy smirked "You should know by now that I always get my way being a Slytherin princess after all are you surprised,""Honestly Pans," Hermione giggled "And I hate to admit this but, yes I\'m very surprised.. How did you invite everyone under a week before we leave I may never know\xe2\x80\xa6" she explained."We had plans for the party for weeks since we\'re leaving tomorrow instead of next week we figured a farewell party was suitable Mione," Luna replied with a daze look "And to celebrate Harry\'s birthday\xe2\x80\xa6 I bet he would\'ve loved it," she murmured"Thank you," Hermione soften her eyes hugging her good friend who\'s like a sister to her knowing Harry would\'ve laughed his arse off if he knew; She turned around to her siblings Jay and Ariel last who were snickering, considering they knew about it "Don\'t tell me you guys knew about this too?""Of course, we did," Ariel snorted "We needed Jay and the kids to spend the whole day with you, so we can prepare the party baby Mia," she sighed dramatically "After all we must wake up early tomorrow," she explained."Thank you," Hermione sincerely meant every word."Always," Jay snickered giving his little sister a hug with Ariel not far behind despite how she\'s only 7 1/2 and two weeks pregnant while Luna is 7 1/2 months and four weeks pregnant apart from each other "And you\'re very welcome after all this is our way of thanking you for winning the war and killing that monster so the rest of us can live in peace\xe2\x80\xa6 so thank you baby sister,""Your welcome," Hermione giggled knowing her brother "Now let\'s just have fun huh?"Hermione nodded knowing this; Charlie Weasley with his two brothers Fred and George Weasley with Ariel and Jay Granger her eldest siblings were coming with her with their kids; Remus and Tonks with little Teddy then James, Seth, Lily, Evie, Henry, Rose, Daisy, Amelia and Hugo with their cousins Logan, Zander, CJ, Sophia, Newton, Nelson, Arianna and Hannah.Draco tells Hermione that Draco and Blaise will be joining them in a few weeks\xe2\x80\x94two weeks at most while Luna being 7 \xc2\xbd months pregnant due date with their daughter Pandora who will be arriving in October and their children Scorpius, Lysander and Lorcan will be accompany them along with Neville, who\'s Blaise husband will be coming with their kids Leonardo and Alice while their surrogate mother expecting triplets\xe2\x80\x94two boys and a girl due date will be coming within 3 \xc2\xbd more months\xe2\x80\x94they haven\'t decided on the names yet but, they\'ll figure out.Hermione nodded knowing this; Charlie Weasley with his two brothers Fred and George Weasley with Ariel and Jay Granger her eldest siblings were coming with her with their kids; Remus and Tonks with little Teddy then James, Seth, Lily, Evie, Henry, Rose, Daisy, Amelia and Hugo with their cousins Logan, Zander, CJ, Sophia, Newton, Nelson, Arianna and Hannah.Draco tells Hermione that they\'ll be joining them in a few weeks\xe2\x80\x94two weeks at most while Luna being 7 \xc2\xbd months pregnant due date with their daughter Pandora who will be arriving in October and their children Scorpius, Lysander and Lorcan will be accompany them along with Neville, who\'s Blaise husband will be coming with their kids Leonardo and Alice while their surrogate mother expecting triplets\xe2\x80\x94two boys and a girl due date will be coming within 3 \xc2\xbd more months\xe2\x80\x94they decided to name them-Vincen Angelo Longbottom-Zabini \'Vinny\' II (OC), Anastasia Selene Longbottom-Zabini \'Aubree\' (OC) and Alejandro Cody Lucas Longbottom-Zabini \'Alex\' (OC) as they were celebrating for the newborn babies.~*~End of Chapter Thirteen~*~Wow that was the longest chapter I wrote since last night and yet it\'s the beginning of a new journey for Hermione and her friends and I know there\'s a lot of questions either or not I\'ll update or not which I\'m not giving up on this story and Hermione and her family are arriving under 24 hours so it won\'t be long till they arrive so get ready because the town folks have no idea who\'s coming and they\'re up for a wild ride that not even the Cullens (cough*Alice*cough) won\'t be able to see in her vision of the unexpected arrivals to Forks. Take that Alice! Lmao (lol) anyway hope you enjoy this story ^_^\nChapter Fourteen: Hermione\'s Farewell Party!Draco and Blaise both had some last-minute things that they had to do that they had to take care of first which she understood beaming as there\'s always room for him which he thanked her gratefully.

Blaise,Neville and Luna explained that they\'re going take the job offer as a muggle teacher until the new boarding school grand opening which will take under a year but, depending on how many projects they\'ll do they\'re excited to do their parts to teach kids about magic as they did when they were children in Hogwarts while Draco will take over the Malfoy business by transferring to La Push Reservation where they\'ll be living while taking part time jobs with Hermione in Forks which seemed to work out for everyone."Professor," Hermione beamed hugging her teachers who greeted her back with a same gesture "It\'s so good to see you guys,""Of course, Hermione we wouldn\'t miss it your farewell party in the world," Professor Flitwick beamed at this "Is that the young ones," he murmured."Yes, this is James, Seth, Henry, Lily and Evie," Hermione beamed looking at her children "And this is Rose, Daisy, Amelia and Hugo Weasley\xe2\x80\x94Ron and Susan\'s children as you can see I\'m their godmother and gained custody over them so they\'re now Rose, Daisy, Amelia and Hugo Weasley-Potter so it would fit them together within our family being their godmother and adopted mother to them," she explained."They\'re a mixture of you and Harry\xe2\x80\xa6along with Rose with their siblings look so much like Ron and Susan too... I\'m so proud of you dear," Professor McGonagall beamed kissing the little ones on the forehead beaming at their nana despite not being related they just call her nana which Professor McGonagall didn\'t mind at all "And the darlings look so beautiful I bet Harry, Ron and Susan are all proud of you and missing so much," she explained."Th\xe2\x80\x94thank you Professor," Hermione whispered holding back her tears."We heard you were leaving in Friday instead of next week in Wednesday we wanted to bid you farewell before you leave," Professor Sprouts softly says hugging her former student.Hermione nodded at this hugging each other her teachers as she\'s going to miss them to bits as they started to chat away with everyone where she greeted Hagrid."Hagrid I\'m so glad you came to my party," Hermione beamed at this "And Grawp I\'m so glad you can make it,""Thank you for inviting me Hermione," Grawp beamed in perfect english."Your very welcome Grawp and I can see you\'re speaking clearly now that\'s great," Hermione beamed patting him on the head while he blushed at this."Wouldn\'t miss for it the world Mione," Hagrid beamed patting her on the head "Going to miss you don\'t forget to visit with the young one\'s yea and Grawp will miss you too. He\'s now speaking clearly now thanks to your help which I couldn\'t thank you enough for that so thank you Hermione," he explained."Of course, Hagrid I\'m sure we would love that and I can never forget you guys," Hermione beamed hugging her friend as he returned the gesture as they started to catch up with everything and beginning to fill their plate with food...as she looked around at her love ones "This is brilliant guys I didn\'t even noticed about the party being busy packing and all," she grinned happily "C\'mon. This is our last night for\xe2\x80\x94well for the time being! Let\'s have some fun," she explained; her chocolate eyes gaze was dancing with amusement as everyone sat down around the table to eat dinner; even the quints her children were laughing talking animating what they did which intrigued Charlie as he\'s a dragon tamer.Charlie along with the rest of the stuff chuckled patting the young ones gently on the head. The rest of the evening passed by easily, filled with laughter, games of exploding snap, embarrassing stories, memories of those that had been lost in the war and promised to write and floo all the time. Hermione even received a digital camera to capture each event and moment at the zoo which looked like a professional camera; one of her hobbies that she bought right before she and Harry got married\xe2\x80\x94she wanted to capture everything even in their honeymoon."Hermione how are you feeling dear," Minerva asked one of her proud students knowing the subject losing Harry was sensitive for the girl."I\'m okay\xe2\x80\xa6 just been busy taking care of the children," Hermione murmured looking at her children who were chatting away with Charlie "I miss him Minerva,"Minerva soften her eyes putting her hands over hers "I know dear and moving away to America sounds like a fresh start for you. It would help ease the pain a bit better than before," she explained."You really think so Minerva?" Hermione murmured."Of course, if anyone who needs a fresh start it would be you dear and I understand why you want to move away to be near your family," Minerva pointed out."Thank you," Hermione smiled at her professor "And I\'ll come visit Hogwarts whenever I could if you need anything just let me know and I\'ll be sure to help,""Thank you, Hermione\xe2\x80\xa6" Minerva beamed at this as she always been fond of Hermione as a child "And now that I think about it\xe2\x80\xa6 only if you don\'t mind of course\xe2\x80\xa6 but, I was wondering when you get settled in down I was hoping you can be our speaker in our graduation class for the students I bet they would\'ve loved to see you dear,"Hermione beamed at this "I would love that Minerva. Just give me the time and date and I\'ll be there," she explained."I\'ll be sure to owl you Hermione," Minerva replied."Actually, Minerva since you asked me and all I\'ll be living in a muggle town so in case the owl mail didn\'t work here\'s my address, my phone number and\xe2\x80\x94" Hermione dug inside her beaded bag and grabbed a package "And this is for you Professor," she explained."For me? You didn\'t have to get me anything Hermione," Professor McGonagall weakly says."I insist besides\xe2\x80\xa6 I didn\'t get one just for you Minerva, I also got one for Professor Flitwick, Professor Sprouts and Hagrid although for Hagrid I had to enlarge their cell phone a bit but, hopefully it will work since I figured we updated the school a bit in Hogwarts maybe you can add electricity to mix up a bit don\'t you think?" Hermione offered.Minerva smiled "That\'s a brilliant idea Hermione but, how are we going to add the electricity if it doesn\'t work in Hogwarts?" she asked.Hermione lips twitched "I think I have an idea only if you\'re okay with-it Minerva," she murmured."Of course, be all means," Minerva offered which Hermione beamed as she told her plan to add the electricity in Hogwarts hopefully it will help for the students who are muggles, half-bloods witches and wizards and all that "That sounds brilliant as always you never seem to disappoint me,\' she explained."Thank you, Minerva that means a lot to me," Hermione murmured as everyone started to chat up the rest of the evening."Of course dear I also heard that you\'re going to build a magical school in your home town in America is that true?" Minerva asked."It is ... I was hoping... it would help the kids who lost their parents... I want to give them hope that there are people who care about them... does that make sense?" Hermione murmured."It really does," Minerva began to say sipping her tea "What else are you planning on doing for the new school Hermione," she explained."Well besides building a new school in my property which is pretty huge take a look," Hermione revealing the blueprints of the property "This is what it looks like right now 550,000 acres wide and long- I was thinking the school could be at least \xe2\x80\xa6 250,000 acres wide and long at least with the Quidditch field added, muggel sports it won\'t just be Quidditch; i\'ll be adding muggle sports so that way we\'ll have more than one sports for everyone to play," she explained."Really\xe2\x80\xa6" Minerva who looked intrigued by this plan of Hermione\'s "It sounds like you know what you want to do for your property anything else you want since it\'s pretty huge?" she explained."Actually I just got a letter from the Raglock that the property that they made a slight miscalculation-it\'s actually 650,000 acres not 550,000 acres so it\'s going to be a lot of projects that we\'re going to do during the year," Hermione explained."Sweet Merlin\xe2\x80\xa6 are you thinking of building a village for everyone?" Filius asked curiously over his former student.Hermione gave a smile "Actually Professor I am I\'m going to build a house for the orphanages since they don\'t have enough food, to sleep, or any bedrooms. I figured I make the children feel like they\'re at home in a way by learning both magic and non magic schools if possible,""That sounds brilliant Hermione, be sure to let us know if you need any help," Pomona asked."I will be sure to owl you guys and let you know what we plan to build in our upcoming projects Professor," Hermione beamed.The evening started to wind down after a few hours has passed Theo and Pansy were the first ones to leave as the pregnancy was making Pansy tired, the next was Charlie who bid everyone goodnight as his room was upstairs across the hall from Hermione\'s room which was Sirius old room so Charlie use Regulus old room since his stuff was packed inside Hermione\'s beaded bag ready to leave along with Fred\'s, George\'s, Ariel\'s and Jay\'s with the kids\' stuff.Minerva, Hagrid and the rest of the staff left had bid everyone after Hermione promised to keep in touch then Remus and Tonks were next as the pregnancy made Tonks tired as well so they bid Hermione good night by offering to put the James, Seth, Lily, Evie, Henry, Rose, Daisy, Amelia, Hugo and Teddy to bed since they had a long day at the zoo, the park and eating ice cream with lots of new toys to play with and books to read. Draco, Neville, Blaise and Luna with their children were the last ones to leave."I guess this is it \xe2\x80\xa6 huh?" Hermione murmured scanning around the Number 12 Grimmauld Place one last time as everything was empty.Draco soften his eyes widen his arms as she rushed into his arms giving her a comfort hug knowing Hermione as they\'re considers themselves as family "We\'ll be okay Mya I promise," he murmured."How do you do it Draco\xe2\x80\xa6" Hermione murmured causing Draco confuse at this "Move on from the chaos that happened in the war,"Draco steadied his breathing "It\'s a slow working progress\xe2\x80\xa6 not going to lie but, I can\'t even imagine losing Harry, Ron, Susan \xe2\x80\xa6 when you did\xe2\x80\xa6 and being a good mother to the kids\xe2\x80\xa6 especially Ron\'s and Susan\'s kids if you didn\'t gain custody over them who knows what could\'ve happened to them but, I\'m glad you did knowing there\'s still death eaters out there I can\'t even imagine what would happen if they found out but, I can tell they love you. I hope I became a good father to my kids too," he murmured."Draco what are you talking about you\'re an amazing father to your kids no matter what you think," Hermione murmured "Despite how we were different sides of the war\xe2\x80\xa6 I think deep down I knew you weren\'t a killer\xe2\x80\xa6 if we were still enemies we wouldn\'t be friends ... maybe allies but, not friends," she whispered."I know\xe2\x80\xa6 "Draco murmured "Who would\'ve thought that I\'d be best friends with the Gryffindor Princess and married to the Ravenclaw princess," he murmured.Hermione giggled "Neither of us did but, you can\'t help but, follow your heart. The heart knows what it wants \xe2\x80\xa6 you and Lulu fell in love it\'s amazing to fall in love don\'t you think?" she murmured."Absolutely," Draco smiled looking at his wife Luna who was putting their children in their strollers with love in his eyes "I know I didn\'t deserve anything but, if it wasn\'t for Luna for giving me a second chance I probably wouldn\'t have you guys as my friends, who I consider as family," he explained."Me either," Hermione murmured as she held her breath "Losing my husband Harry was hard enough along with Ron, Susan and some of Ron\'s family his parents Arthur, Molly, Bill and his wife Fleur with their children \xe2\x80\xa6then Percy... with his wife Audrey then Ginny with their children\xe2\x80\xa6 It was hard since they\'re mostly who I hang out with as friends but, I\'m glad that I didn\'t lose you guys and I\'m glad we became friends Draco\xe2\x80\xa6 it would\'ve been devastating," she explained.Draco nodded at this "I know and I\'m glad I didn\'t lose you either Mya," he murmured turning to Luna, his wife and their children."Me too so I guess I\'ll see you guys tomorrow since we\'re going to transfer the burials at the burial for everyone to Forks," Hermione murmured."Yes, did you manage to talk to Aqua and Ruby to help out with the burials back in Forks?""I did they\'re actually setting up the burials just the ones we have here but, under my protection since it\'s going to be near my parents grave\xe2\x80\xa6 it would be protected and I also learned the property was miscalculated \xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s now 650,000 acres not 550,000 acres "Draco steadied his breathing looking at the map of Forks noticing the markings around town "Bloody hell that\'s like half of the reservation of La Push and part of the town isn\'t it?" he began to say with a raise eyebrow causing Hermione to nod at this "Well we\'ll figure out when we land to Forks huh and that\'s good I\'m glad we can get this over with so where do we meet tomorrow being our last day in England?""Here at the manor and then we can head to the cemetery in the morning the early the better I don\'t want to risk anything especially the death eaters\xe2\x80\xa6 I don\'t want them to .. do any dark magic over my family\xe2\x80\xa6 despite how it\'s protected with my powerful spells..""I agree so I wasn\'t sure if Luna told you but, Blaise and I have a last minute meeting back in Italy so we\'ll be meeting you guys there probably in two weeks from now,""Really what for?" Hermione asked.Draco shrugged at this "Nothing for you to worry about. All you need to worry is to relax back home\xe2\x80\xa6 and introduce us to your childhood home,""Are you sure?""Yeah I\'m positive Blaise and I got this,""Alright if you\'re sure\xe2\x80\xa6 so what day are you and Blaise going to arrive do you know?"Draco rubbed his chin deep in thought looking at Blaise who got the message joining them into conversation who immediately rushed over."We\'ll be arriving within two weeks at most Mya don\'t worry we\'ll be able to help fix up the manor if necessary just promise us that you\'ll watch over our loves and family hmm?" Blaise asked."Always," Hermione answered with a determined look causing the Slytherins princes to chuckle."Good, see you guys bright and early in the morning," Draco murmured and kissed her forehead as he nodded at the gang who saluted him goodbye before apparating away to head home."Mya I\'ll see you guys tomorrow," Luna whispered hugging her best friend who\'s like a sister to her."See you guys tomorrow and don\'t worry once we arrived in Forks, Washington I\'ll show you guys around my hometown it\'s a small town but, it\'s home," Hermione murmured."I\'m pretty sure the children and I will love that very much," Luna told her with a nod."Sounds like a plan Lulu," Hermione hugged Luna who returned the hug "This party was a huge blast and to see you everyone it was rather fun I haven\'t that much fun in years..." she then turned to Blaise and Neville "Thank you guys for coming and for the party," she explained."Anything for you Mione," Neville smiled hugging his sister but, blood "Like we would ever miss this party for anything. You deserve it after everything you, Harry, and Ron along with Susan with our friends who lost their lives in the war did this is just us thanking you for doing what you did winning the war and killed that son of a bitch. We\'ll see you in the morning," he explained.Hermione gave a sad smile knowing her husband Harry" You know Harry\xe2\x80\xa6 he didn\'t want our home to get hurt by that bastard\xe2\x80\xa6" she drifted off holding her locket as if it\'s her life depends on it "And I will see you guys tomorrow did you guys already packed everything," she explained."Yes, we did we packed everything ready to go and we\'ll meet you guys at the airport tomorrow," Neville nodded at this "Blaise and Draco would be meeting us later though did they told you that," Hermione nodded at this to confirm "It wouldn\'t be the first time they been away for a business trip but, they\'ll be arriving in two weeks at most," he explained."They told me and that sounds brilliant Nev and I can\'t wait to show you guys around town," Hermione smiled at her friends "And we can set up that Quidditch pitch like we planned and other ideas we can come up with don\'t you think?" she explained."Absolutely," Luna nodded at this "And we can give them a proper burial in Forks so we can be together spiritual and in our hearts with plans to build in our property since it\'s pretty huge how big is it again," she explained."Exactly 850,000 acres not 550,000 acres from what I heard from Raglook," Hermione beamed at this "I\'m so glad we can transfer them not wanting\xe2\x80\xa6 anything bad happening to their graves," she murmured."Yes it is a big property and we wouldn\'t want that," Luna murmured."Mya don\'t you dare set up the Quidditch pitch without us huh?" Draco called out in the background."Wouldn\'t dream of it Draco and goodnight guys be safe," Hermione waved \'goodbye\' to her friends as they apparate away to their homes for the night "See you tomorrow," she explained."Good night Mione see you guys bright and early," Neville nodded at this as he put on his jackets and grabbed the twins Leo and Ali who are now asleep tired from all the fun "Where should we meet up tomorrow?""We should meet here bright and early say\xe2\x80\xa6 9:30ish sound about right I\'ll make breakfast," Hermione told him."Sounds perfect we\'ll see you tomorrow Mione," Neville nodded in agreement waved goodbye as they grabbed their children apparated away to their home "Bright and early Mione,""Of course," Hermione nodded at this as she muttered a cleaning spell by cleaning everything out and threw the trash; the cake that Tonks made was all gone.Hermione learned they bought mocha cake was her favorite from a small bakery they found in muggle London; she and Harry went around the Asian region in their honeymoon including the Philippines; they found a small bakery in Manila and curiously got the best of her and went to try one of the desserts and chose Mocha chocolate which was delicious that they bought a cake to celebrate their honeymoon that day. Fred and George happened to be in the living room with Remus and Tonks as they were discussing the schedule times for their flight tomorrow morning."Hey, you guys still awake?" Hermione asked as she entered the living room."Yeah, we just wanted to show Remus these journals that we\'ve been working on, they\'re about a galleon that you made from the DA back in your 5th year they convey messages and only the owner of the twin book can read the messages otherwise it looks like notes for whatever you wish," Fred announced; his blue eyes lit up in excitement."Really?" Hermione asked as her eyes was light up with excitement."Yeah! We\'re only made 14 for the first ones! One for me, Fred, Lee, Ariel, Charlie, Draco, Luna, Neville, Blaise, Pansy, Theo, Jay, Ruby, and for the main guest of honor you," George announced, "And you can also make messages go between you and the one other person or two other people depending on the name you write then you first open it for the day,""You can even say or erase pages on whether you think it\'s important or not," Fred announced."They\'re not done yet but, they will be soon so we\'ll owl you one when we\'re done \'Mione," the twins volleyed back and forth while the other three others listened and nodded."That\'s brilliant boys! That\'s not easy magic! I\'m very impressed. If you need any help do let me know alright," Hermione replied; the twins nodded and hugged everyone saying goodnight and head to bed since they\'re leaving with Hermione early in the morning.Remus, Tonks with little Teddy, Charlie, Fred, George Weasley with his wife Ariel and their kids; Percy II (OC), Esmeralda \'Emery\' (OC), Arthur Corey II (OC); Ariel however is pregnant with triplets\xe2\x80\x94two boys and a girl they both decided to name after Fred, George and Charlie\'s siblings. William \'Billy\' II, Ronald \'Ronny\' II, and Ginevra \'Ginny\' II to represent them knowing if they\'re alive they would\'ve been honored by that. Hermione sighed looking around the house since it\'s now bare since she has no use of this house anymore\xe2\x80\x94Kretcher, and the other elves were fixing up the Manor in La Push Reservation\xe2\x80\x94the Black Pearl Manor."Thanks, Mione," Fred and George answered together "We would\'ve done this without your help Mione,""Aww thanks guys that\'s sweet we should head to bed we just have to pack the last furniture and we should be done and leave later tomorrow,""Right-O Mione," Fred saluted first heading to his room "See you in the morning night Forge,""Night Gred," George nodded at his brother."See you in the morning Freddie and goodnight," Hermione smiled "Are you going to bed Georgie?""Yeah in a bit I just need to finish this one thing and\xe2\x80\x94" George muttered a few twists "And done! What do you think? This is for you," he announced."Me? You didn\'t have to do that George," Hermione weakly says.George soften his eyes "I know I don\'t but, I\'ve been working on this for awhile and finally have some free time and besides\xe2\x80\xa6 it was \xe2\x80\xa6 from Harry\xe2\x80\xa6 it was his last wish for us to give to you \xe2\x80\xa6 I didn\'t get to finish it before but, we finally managed to fix it up and figured you would want it back," he explained."Ha-harry last wish?" Hermione murmured "I\'ve been hearing that today a lot lately,"George nodded at this "Yep, he went to our store\xe2\x80\xa6 the day he was killed it was before he went to the mission\xe2\x80\xa6 and wanted to talk to us\xe2\x80\xa6 Fred and I anyway to pick this beauty up, I noticed it was a bit rusty and a little old so I fixed it up; Harry said something that it belonged to your grandmother heirloom from her side of the family and said it was really precious to you," he murmured.Hermione gasps seeing the music box and felt teared up, grabbing her key from her necklace and turned the key thus the music was heard\xe2\x80\x94 \'Can\'t Help Falling in Love\' was their wedding song that she closed her eyes sadly "Harry\xe2\x80\xa6he remember" she whispered."Cookie," Ariel peeked through the living room doorway seeing her sister teared up "What\'s wrong?" she wobbled over to her sister.Hermione covered her mouth "Apparently Harry fixed the music box from nana \xe2\x80\xa6 it was broken and\xe2\x80\xa6I thought I lost it forever during the war.. I couldn\'t find anywhere in the attic I thought it was stolen \xe2\x80\xa6 and Harry\xe2\x80\xa6 he must\'ve found it\xe2\x80\xa6he knew how much this music box meant so much to me \xe2\x80\xa6 and he asked George and Fred to fix it\xe2\x80\xa6it\'s playing our song it\'s almost like I can feel him next to me... I miss him so much," she explained, feeling more teared up and sobbed over her sister Ariel who rushed over to hug her baby sister causing the two to comfort each other."Shhh it\'s okay\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s okay I\'m here \xe2\x80\xa6 I\'m here cookie bear just let it out," Ariel murmured looking at her husband George who nodded leaving the two alone knowing they needed a sister talk.After a few minutes Hermione felt a bit better "Sorry for ruining your shirt," she murmured.Ariel lifted her sister\'s chin to look up to her "Hey don\'t ever apologize you can cry on my shoulder I won\'t judge cookie bear I\'m always here if you want to talk,"Hermione sniffed "Thanks Ariel,""Of course, are you sure you\'re going to be okay\xe2\x80\xa6and that was really sweet of Harry to find nana\'s music box that was favorite jewelry box as a child" Ariel worriedly asked.Hermione nodded at this "Yeah it was and\xe2\x80\xa6 I\'ll be alright\xe2\x80\xa6 I\'m just going to head to bed in a bit anyway\xe2\x80\xa6 I\'ll see you in the morning,""See you in the morning," Ariel murmured as she headed to her room joining George in bed as he took off his shirt turning to his wife."Hey, how was she? I didn\'t mean to get her upset\xe2\x80\xa6" George bowed his head sadly causing Ariel to smile at her husband "Is she okay?""She\'s not upset with you Georgie the music box meant so much to her our nana gave it to Hermione as a child before she pass away\xe2\x80\xa6 it was the only thing that she ever had of nana Hermione," Ariel sighed tiredly changing her clothes into her pajamas "How did Harry find it she thought she lost it forever," she whispered."I\'m not sure\xe2\x80\xa6 Harry just said that it just\xe2\x80\xa6 appeared in front of him one day\xe2\x80\xa6 as if \xe2\x80\xa6 it was a sign for him to find it or something\xe2\x80\xa6 and told us to fix it up for Hermione since he knew it meant so much to her," George whispered."Odd but, that music box isn\'t just a regular one\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s magical\xe2\x80\xa6 apparently nana Hermione got it from her first love\xe2\x80\xa6 you wouldn\'t believe me if I told you," Ariel whispered."Try me? I can take it," George murmured."Nana Hermione first love gave that pacific music box to her during the war\xe2\x80\xa6 before .. they got separated\xe2\x80\xa6""Who?""Famous author \xe2\x80\xa6 of the Fantastic Beast and Where to Find them mean anything to you?""Newt Scamander\xe2\x80\xa6 that\'s your nana\'s first love?""Yes it is before they got separated?""How?""Well\xe2\x80\xa6 nana was \xe2\x80\xa6 special like us\xe2\x80\xa6 mysterious it\'s one of the things that attracted Newt the most about nana\xe2\x80\xa6 she was different from the other girls that he ever met,""Really?""Mhmm,""Bloody hell\xe2\x80\xa6 well it\'s a good thing Harry found the jewelry box then isn\'t it?""It is and also it\'s a good luck charm\xe2\x80\xa6 rumor has it it would lead you to your soul mate and I think that\'s what the music box did\xe2\x80\xa6 it found Harry,""Whoa\xe2\x80\xa6" George began to say holding his wife into a hug "I had a feeling you\'d say that \xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s a good thing thing we\'re leaving this place\xe2\x80\xa6 and it will good for us, our kids\xe2\x80\xa6 for Jay\xe2\x80\xa6 especially Hermione and the kids...I know that for sure," he explained."Why is it whenever something good happens something terrible happens in our family\xe2\x80\xa6 you lose half of your family\xe2\x80\xa6 I lose mine\xe2\x80\xa6 with the kids \xe2\x80\xa6 what if\xe2\x80\x94" Ariel started to ramble only to be cut off by her husband "Especially with my sister," she whispered."Hey, look at me," George looked at his wife Ariel cupping her face softly wiping her tears gently "Nothing is going to happen to either of us us it\'s one of the reasons why we agreed to move away from England to get away from that\xe2\x80\xa6. as much as I want our kids to attend Hogwarts\xe2\x80\xa6 there\'s still death eaters that are still out there who want revenge against Hermione and everyone in it who were in the light side and I\'d be damn if anything happens to her\xe2\x80\xa6 I promised Harry and Ron that I protect her\xe2\x80\xa6 and that\'s what I intend to do \xe2\x80\xa6 including our family," he explained.Ariel looked at her husband George in confusion "What do you mean \xe2\x80\xa6 you talked to Harry and Ron?" she sputtered at this "That\'s \xe2\x80\xa6 impossible\xe2\x80\xa6are you saying their\xe2\x80\xa6 alive\xe2\x80\xa6" she whispered.George grew quiet shaking his head "No, of course not I would never disrespect Hermione like that\xe2\x80\xa6 we saw their bodies luv\xe2\x80\xa6 it was before\xe2\x80\xa6they both killed.. when Fred and I talked to them\xe2\x80\xa6 separately\xe2\x80\xa6. something changed that night I had a feeling Ron and Harry knew more than they let on and I knew they\'re not allowed to say much about their missions but, that night\xe2\x80\xa6 it felt like it was the last time I see them ya know\xe2\x80\xa6" he whispered.Ariel stared at her husband for a long moment "Well I wouldn\'t blame you\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s almost like...with my last fianc\xc3\xa9e Anthony\xe2\x80\xa6it was before he got killed from the death eaters\xe2\x80\xa6and\xe2\x80\x94" she held her breath as she laid down her head against George\'s chest while he held her close "I just wish I knew how to help Hermione move on with her life\xe2\x80\xa6 is all," she whispered."I think we all do luv\xe2\x80\xa6 but, I think one day \xe2\x80\xa6 she\'ll move on with her life\xe2\x80\xa6 just like Jay would too..." George whispered."I hope so\xe2\x80\xa6 I really hope so\xe2\x80\xa6" Ariel whispered as they both fell asleep for the night until the next morning to get ready for their flight which isn\'t till midnight in Friday so they have a whole day to double check everything not realizing that Teddy Lupin was awake staring at the moon which Remus noticed his eldest son still awake in his room."Teddy why are you still awake we have to\xe2\x80\x94" Remus stopped to realize that Teddy was staring at the moon "Teddy what is it?" he explained."Dad\xe2\x80\xa6 do you ever believe in angels\xe2\x80\xa6?" Teddy hoarse staring at the window "Like real angels," he whispered.Remus furrowed his eyebrows "Of course son why do you ask?" he asked."I was just wondering do you think it\'s possible that someone can come back from the dead even though they stated they were dead even though they\'re not\xe2\x80\xa6""Teddy \xe2\x80\xa6 what are you talking about?"Teddy sighed as he promised his godfather that he wouldn\'t say anything so he\'s a bit conflicted by the whole thing "I just\xe2\x80\xa6 I miss uncle Harry dad\xe2\x80\xa6" he whispered.Remus frowned rushing over to his son sitting next to him "I know you do I miss him too\xe2\x80\xa6. he\'s the only \xe2\x80\xa6 family member of the Potter\'s line and now he\'s gone\xe2\x80\xa6 well besides Hermione and the kids of course but, still\xe2\x80\xa6 but, there\'s nothing we can do \xe2\x80\xa6 but, move on with our lives Teddy,""But, what if \xe2\x80\xa6hypothetically speaking he was alive\xe2\x80\xa6 wouldn\'t you do anything to help him dad?""You know I would do anything in my power to get him back including my friends... so we can be together again but, it\'s impossible Teddy you can\'t bring anyone from the dead son\xe2\x80\xa6 I learned that a long time ago,"Teddy licked his lips nervously "Okay\xe2\x80\xa6""Why are you asking anyway?""Just curious...it\'s been on my mind for awhile that\'s all\xe2\x80\xa6"Remus stared at his son for a long minute "Are you sure \xe2\x80\xa6 you\'re okay?" he began to say causing Teddy to nod at this "You seemed...quiet at the party than usual a few hours ago\xe2\x80\xa6 anything on your mind that you want to talk about?""Well\xe2\x80\xa6 I do have a question?""Shoot?""What do you know about creature inheritance that hatch in an egg?""An egg?""Yes\xe2\x80\xa6""Like a chicken egg?""More like \xe2\x80\xa6 a bird egg but, yes I suppose you can say it like that\xe2\x80\xa6""Depending on the creature inheritance \xe2\x80\xa6 it would have to hatch in it\'s habitat in it\'s stronger point why?""No reason\xe2\x80\xa6 just\xe2\x80\xa6 a bit of light reading\xe2\x80\xa6""Light reading really?""Well\xe2\x80\xa6 you can never know auntie Minnie has four forms in animagus she has to be the strongest and powerful muggleborn witch in all England,""More like pureblood witch Teddy?""Pureblood?""Yes, Hermione is a pureblood witches including Jay and Ariel they\'re all purebloods they just didn\'t show it off not wanting the reporters to twist the story \xe2\x80\xa6 her parents Daniel and Emma Granger are actually Henry and Emmeline Marlstone-Wells family-the Montresor would be Hermione\'s mum\'s maiden name so technically her uncle Charlie is also a pureblood wizard but, he lost his magic when he was a teenager I believe\xe2\x80\xa6 and became squib\xe2\x80\xa6 his parents rather him alive as a squib then nothing at all; unlike some pureblood families they actually love their children with much love they can ever give,""Whoa\xe2\x80\xa6" Teddy grew quiet looking up at his dad "Hey dad does uncle Harry knew about auntie Minnie heritage,""Oh yeah he knew he was just as surprised as she was along with the rest of the Weasley\'s the ones in the Order of the Phoenix knew about Hermione\'s heritage but, kept that information for the ones who were close to Hermione so only a few of us knew about it,""Wow\xe2\x80\xa6 so her parents who were muggles they were in hiding from the wizarding world?""More like hiding from Voldemort \xe2\x80\xa6 and his death eaters since they were in his hit list to kill-" Remus began to say then took a deep breath to steady himself "Apparently they\'re one of the Ancient and Noble Purebloods who are rather rich from the Montresor and Marlstone-Wells family line,""Really how do you know that dad?""I always known for awhile and I may\'ve knew about it since Hermione\'s 5th year why?""I didn\'t know that auntie Minnie was a pureblood like us?""Your uncle Harry is also a pureblood since Lily his mum is adopted-apparently her dad is her actual brother being Minerva\'s son from her 2nd marriage with her husband," Remus sighed tiredly leaving Teddy to gawk at him "That\'s exactly what Harry looked like when he learned the news, it\'s rather a lot don\'t you think?" he explained."It is \xe2\x80\xa6 a lot to take in dad\xe2\x80\xa6" Teddy began to say with a sad tone "I just wish he didn\'t have to leave us so soon," he whispered."I know \xe2\x80\xa6 Harry loved you kiddo more than you ever know he would do everything in his power to protect everyone he loved that included you \xe2\x80\xa6 " Remus began to say noticing his son Teddy looking a bit conflicted "But, we\'re not talking about your godfather Harry are we?" he explained.Teddy sighed tiredly "No\xe2\x80\xa6 not in particular\xe2\x80\xa6""What\'s on your mind son?""It\'s just\xe2\x80\xa6 I know we\'re moving away to America\xe2\x80\xa6 but, where am I going to school?" Teddy asked.Remus held his breath "Your mother and I decided to enroll you into a muggle school but, apparently your godmother Hermione told us that she\'s building a magical school just like Hogwarts but, calling it \'Black Pearl Witchcraft and Wizardry Magic Academy or something like that she\'s still working on the title but, I know it\'s Black Pearl-the property that we\'re going to live in it\'s rather huge so your godmother is going to be rather busy with a loads of projects building this school for both magic and non magic children all over the world at least in our mini village anyway," he explained."Really?" Teddy looked a little excitedly "How big is it going to be?" he asked."I\'m not exactly sure\xe2\x80\xa6" Remus rubbed his chin in thought "But, until then you\'re going to be with your cousins attending a muggle school since the magical school hasn\'t been built yet so we have a long way to go so until then you\'ll be with your cousins in Salem Academy of Magic what do you think?" he explained,Teddy gave a smile "Really that\'s brilliant dad\xe2\x80\xa6are you sure I can\'t go back to Hogwarts like you and mom did?" he asked."I\'m sure but, if anything if the school doesn\'t work out we\'ll consider sending you and the kids to Hogwarts only if you guys want too," Remus assured his son who beamed at this "And the new magical academy that Hermione is working on-we\'re still working how big we want to be," he explained."Really are you sure?" Teddy asked."Yeah but, I think you should try the muggle school as well since there\'s other schools that Hermione wants to enroll you kids there,""Auntie Minnie really wants us to live in a muggle town huh?" Teddy asked."She does\xe2\x80\xa6 she wants us to start fresh and what\'s better the town that she grew up has no idea that magic exists since it\'s a muggle town,""So, we can\'t do magic?" Teddy pouted "Awe man\xe2\x80\xa6" he kicked the floor sadly."You can do magic in the house well manor and in your school but, not around the muggles no,"Teddy debated at this "Okay that sounds fair," he nodded at this with a tired yawn "I\'m going to head to bed since it\'s rather late night dad," he murmured hugging his dad."Night son we have to wake up quite early tomorrow?" Remus asked."Huh where are we going?""To the cemetery?""The \xe2\x80\xa6 cemetery for what""The burials where everyone is buried\xe2\x80\xa6 Arthur, Molly, Bill, Fleur, Percy, Audrey, Weasley Ginny and her husband Seamus Finnigan with their children,the Weasleys, Dean Thomas and his wife Hannah with their children who were also killed that same day since we never did find out what happened to Dean\'s or Hannah\'s side of the same since they\'re all dead so \xe2\x80\xa6. Hermione decided to bring them along with Sirius, Harry, his parents James and Lily Potter\'s, Jay\'s late wife Mal and late sister-in-law Sophia\'s burials we\'re going to transfer them to Forks, Washington cemetery it should be there by the time we arrive in Friday,""Really? Can we do that\xe2\x80\xa6""Yes we have full permission to do that we\'re going to transfer the ones that we\'re going to bring along with us that\'s all,""How long does it usually take?""Usually a month but, your godmother Hermione and cousin Draco know people from higher places that can transfer under a week?""Really that quick huh?""Yeah Hermione called in advance and been planning to do this for awhile\xe2\x80\xa6so that way we can visit them whenever we want,""So we\'re just going to the burials tomorrow and then what?""Then your cousin Draco and uncle Blaise will go to the bank to transfer the rest of the stuff that we don\'t need inside the boxes inside the Black\'s vaults at Gringotts Bank since we don\'t need them,""Oh\xe2\x80\xa6 how long will that take?""Not very long I don\'t think you kids are going with us though it\'s just Hermione, Draco and the others while you kids stay here it\'s less stressful that way,""Awe why can\'t we go dad?""Not this time it\'s dangerous besides your grandmother will watch over you along with your aunt Narcissa and uncle Lucius?""How come we can\'t go?""It\'s dangerous son neither of us want you kids to get hurt\xe2\x80\xa6and I need you to help your mother making sure she\'s not packing the heavy stuff since she\'s not supposed to move much,""Do I have too?""Yes considering your mother is pregnant with your siblings son remember?""Oh yeah\xe2\x80\xa6" Teddy flushed at this "I kinda forgot so what time do we leave at the airport?""We\'re going to leave in midnight less people the better and our flight is 3:30 in the morning,""What that\'s so early dad?""I know but, we don\'t want the reporters to find out that we\'re leaving across the country so it\'s better safe than sorry,"Teddy sighed "Okay I\'ll see you in the morning dad,""See you in the morning Teddy,"[Forks, Washington\xe2\x80\x94Police Station] \xe2\x80\xa6Charlie Swan was currently working at the police case in Seattle, Washington with his partners Eric and Johnny, he was a bit worried for his only daughter Bella ever since she got back from Italy with Edward carrying her unconscious, she\'s been paying attention on only Edward Cullen and only him not even visiting Jacob Black her supposed best friend. Although what his ex-wife Renee or his daughter knew was that he got married young to Aaliyah Black, Billy\'s sister where everyone knows her as Nova and gained four boys, expecting a baby girl but, that was before his whole entire family was murdered by a monster\xe2\x80\xa6 name Voldemort\xe2\x80\xa6 a dark wizard who wanted to take over the Wizardly World; this was before he met Renee in his 20\'s he was only 29 years old when he met Renee as they were in love once.His ex wife Renee never knew he was married before and he likes to keep his private life private, he hasn\'t thought about the old days in so long\xe2\x80\xa6living in a muggle town in America tends to do that... the last day before he lost the love of his Aaliyah was that she was going to tell him some good news only he never knew what that news until Billy told him-that was until he and Billy learned she and the boys were murdered that night it\'s probably why he\'s always close off and keeps to himself away from the town folk in Forks.However, being the head chief of police in Forks, Washington helped Charlie heal over the years after his divorce with Renee bring their daughter Bella with her\xe2\x80\xa6hurt him to the core reminding him of his past that he refused to talk about and worked extra hard becoming an important role model to the kids especially the ones who he considers as family, he was known one of the patient, calm man but, when you get to his bad side let\'s just say it isn\'t pretty like his daughter for example\xe2\x80\xa6 he didn\'t appreciate what his daughter was doing to his godson Jacob Black. He was also excited why? Because his nieces Ariel Weasley, Hermione Potter, and Jayden Granger with their kids are finally coming home after so long the last time his youngest niece Hermione visit was when she was 13 years old it was before it got really dangerous in England.Jay however, his eldest nephew and his niece Ariel were living here in Forks a few years ago to protect the town from the death eaters during the war back in England so he pretty much knew about the Wizarding World but, didn\'t realize that his youngest niece had to be the one to destroy the same man who murdered his family\xe2\x80\xa6 Aaliyah\xe2\x80\xa6 Logan\xe2\x80\xa6 Zander\xe2\x80\xa6 Jake\xe2\x80\xa6Tyler...it was too much for the guy to learn his whole entire family was murdered by him...it gave him some time to heal over the loss of his family but, it helped him move on for a little while; the minute he learned that Hermione his niece had to fight in that war he was worried he didn\'t want to lose her who was so young to fight in the battle of the war he couldn\'t imagine how horrible it was to find his once home in chaos once more\xe2\x80\xa6.and after they won the war that was until Jay told him that he and his family were moving back in England as it was now in peace-obviously they kept the house as he\'ll be coming to visit during business trips along the way but, that was before Jay lost his late wife Mal during the raid of death eaters\xe2\x80\xa6 in St. Mungo\'s no less.He couldn\'t imagine how hard it was for Jay after all he went through it losing his first wife Aaliyah after all but, to learn that Maliyah got killed during the raid of death eaters\xe2\x80\xa6 being rape, tortured, slashed, etc that\'s even worse\xe2\x80\xa6 he felt like he failed as an uncle towards his nephew but, he had his best friend Charlie Weasley help to support him and heal his heart at least that\'s what he heard from Ariel anyway; however for his youngest niece Hermione losing her husband during an auror mission that\'s even hard for Charlie that he felt his heart broken once more leaving both Jay and Hermione single widow father and mother to their kids. He couldn\'t imagine how hard that was...thinking they\'ll be in peace in England those years ago although Jay didn\'t want to leave him behind which Charlie told him that he\'ll be fine considering he won\'t be by himself he had Billy, Harry and Sue with his friends along with their kids so he\'s not really by himself.Charlie however, couldn\'t contain his excitement as he couldn\'t wait till his family comes back home preparing everything for his family with his grandkids coming, before Hermione told him that they\'re coming back home he was dealing with Edward asking his daughter Bella to marry him he didn\'t even bother to ask his permission to ask his daughter hand in marriage until the last minute despite how they\'ve been dating under 2 years it didn\'t take a rocket science to figure that out that something was off about the Cullens not that he had a problem with Dr. Cullen he respects him and Esme a lot as they\'re his good friends, Alice Cullen too but, not the rest of his family\xe2\x80\x94especially Edward Cullen who not only broke up with his daughter Bella and broke her heart for the year when the Cullens moved away during their junior year because Dr. Cullen had a job offer in Los Angeles only to learn they\'re now back last summer as if nothing has changed between them.Although for Charlie he couldn\'t help but, feel irritated by the whole since his daughter Bella told him that they\'re going to get married right after high school \xe2\x80\xa6 he always hoped that she\'d want to go college only to learn she got into college in Alaska not only it\'s far away but, it wasn\'t anything he had planned. His daughter was only eighteen years old for Merlin\'s sake, he couldn\'t help but, snort at this and yet his youngest niece Hermione was more mature that his daughter and had more dignity than that and now he\'s supposed to be happy for his daughter and hoped that his ex-wife Renee would talk sense into her and back him up only to find out that Renee supports her decision to get married young so now he\'s back to square one. He felt so frustrated on how stubborn his daughter Bella being; at least he has his nephew Jay and his nieces Ariel and Hermione with his grandkids though as far as he knew his daughter has no idea about magic even existed and liked to keep his past to himself.~*~End of Chapter Fourteen~*~Whooooo! Wow that\'s a long chapter. I know, I know that there\'s some reviewers who are wondering when Hermione and her family arriving to Forks but, don\'t worry they\'ll be arriving quite soon between the chapters it\'s going to be a back and forth between Forks, Washington and the Wizarding World between what they\'re doing so it won\'t be long till they arrive.\nChapter Fifteen: Elder\'s Talk & the Gossip Talk!The last time Charlie saw his youngest niece Hermione was when she was getting married to her fianc\xc3\xa9e Harry Potter who happens to be her best friend since they were 11 years old in Hogwarts, they held a small wedding it wasn\'t fancy or anything since neither of them wanted anything to big but, it was enough. It was before he lost his little sister Emma and his brother in-law Daniel who were very supportive of their youngest daughter Hermione as they adore Harry as he\'s their son too including Charlie. He respects Harry very much and knew he made his niece Hermione happy and made him a grandpa well uncle grandpa but, he didn\'t seem to mind really, and it was practically illegal where they\'re from so \xe2\x80\xa6 it had good points for both parents.Charlie Swan, Emma and Daniel Granger walked Hermione down the aisle as they were all honored for that suggestion since their parents walked down Ariel and Jay when they got married before Hermione graduated from their boarding school in Hogwarts the same school that he went too, married his first wife Aaliyah gained kids before they got killed this was way before he met his 2nd wife Renee and got into a divorce bringing their daughter Bella with her causing him to be quite lonely. There\'s a lot of things that Charlie Swan never told his daughter as they never were close \xe2\x80\xa6especially his ex-wife Renee\xe2\x80\xa6 he never told her about his life or that he used to be a pureblood wizard then lost his magic and became a squib in the end as he decided to keep it to himself no matter the cost and felt relieved that their daughter don\'t have magic she\'s pure muggle who she inherited from Renee his ex-wife.He didn\'t seem to mind though his little sister Emma has magic in her veins and their kids would have the same. When his youngest niece Hermione called him a few days ago\xe2\x80\x94well like the beginning of the year then called him in April then again another a few days ago so you can say they been talking every other day whenever they have time to catch up and ecstatic that his youngest niece is alright especially being the mother of Quintuplets \'Quints\' he was shocked to also learn that he\'s also the godfather and grandfather uncle to those quints while adopting her friends Ron and Susan\'s kids after being killed and felt honored leaving their kids orphans it broke his heart learning what happen the last of his old friends. Ariel and Jay are the only ones to know about Bella\'s upbringing that happened in Forks and let\'s just say they aren\'t happy about it.Once they started catching up that\'s when Charlie told Hermione what happened between Bella and Jacob\'s friendship much to his surprise Hermione is supportive with her uncle Charlie, telling him that she\'ll help heal Jacob from Bella\'s grasp apparently she knew what happen between them and well-let\'s just say she swore in different languages that even Charlie was stunned by her words, after she insisted that she hopes that Jake will move on with his life much to Charlie\'s relief he gave the same message to Billy Black who\'s also worried over his only son that Billy told Charlie to tell Hermione that he appreciates the gesture to help whenever she could.So many things have happened over the past two years ... like this past summer of last year during the bear hunt\xe2\x80\x94at least he thought he was until Jay told him that they\'re hunting for trespassers like vampires who could be on a killing spree in Seattle, Washington that they ended up in a small town called Forks\xe2\x80\x94or in most cases in the reservation in La Push to start trouble. The only thing that brought Charlie\'s attention was that he was ecstatic to hear his best friend Harry Clearwater was alright since his nephew Jayden was there by saving his life, while recruiting an army against Victoria a vampire and her in-coming army that was coming to Forks that year explaining everything that happened from the past couple of years in the Wizarding World\xe2\x80\x94Jayden his nephew helped with the Second Wizarding War with his friends, along with Ariel and Hermione much to his worrisome but, knew they\'d be alright though; he felt so relieved when he heard that both Jay and Ariel are alright during the war before the whole thing happened.Jayden his nephew helped with the Second Wizarding War with his friends, along with Ariel and Hermione much to his worrisome but, knew they\'d be alright though; he felt so relieved when he heard that both Jay and Ariel are alright during the war before the whole thing happened. This was before Jay told their uncle Charlie about the Second Wizarding War in Europe and how very involved within the war especially with his little niece Hermione Potter \'nee Granger was part of this war, threats were coming and the only people who can destroy this monster was her late husband Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and herself.This was before Jay told their uncle Charlie about the Wizarding War in Europe and how involved they were especially since Hermione Potter \'nee Granger was part of that war being the heroine hero that she was; he was very worried over his little niece but, felt proud that she would fight for her people, to be free etc and when Ariel called him to tell them that their coming back home in Forks he couldn\'t be more happy to see his family again he practically jumped for joy gleefully that it made Bella stare at him weirdly then shrug it off going on a date with Edward not even when she told him that she\'s going to be staying with her mum for the whole summer until school starts; obviously it didn\'t stop Charlie from jumping for joy ignoring the gawking looks from both Edward and Bella as he took his new car and drove to Billy\'s house and told him the happy news the minute he found out that Hermione, Jay and Ariel are coming home and celebrated that day bringing their children so there\'s going to be children running around in town.Once Charlie heard the news he made all sorts of arrangements for the house that their parents bought which is still under their names under their parents wills so it was pretty much Jay\'s, Ariel\'s and Hermione\'s properties really after he fixes it up that is. It was as bit dusty but, still a good house he took care of it after visiting him every other summer that they bought a house to live near him which was helpful for Charlie since he didn\'t have other families left besides the one in England.That was until he talked to Hermione the other day telling him about the properties that she found under the Black\'s family\xe2\x80\x94Charlie felt confuse at first until Hermione explained to him that Harry\'s godfather Sirius Black who happens to be Billy\'s Black cousin gave money to Hermione in his will including the properties to Harry her husband and when Harry died he gave everything to Hermione and their children so you can say his little niece is very rich which means she\'s going to be quite busy living in the one the \'Black Pearl\' Manor which is what it\'s called although she does have to go to a muggle high school to blend in despite how she\'s over 18 years old to keep in appearances.Apparently Hermione made plans for herself instead of enrolling into a muggle school, she\'s going to portray as a student, when she\'s going to be in disguise being their teacher and not only that but, she bought the only resident high schools in Forks. Forks High where his daughter Bella attend and LaPush High in the reservation. When Charlie heard this plan he couldn\'t help but, laugh as it reminded him of his sister being the mischief trouble maker with her twin brother Eric. She made all sorts of arrangements and changes around the schools since LaPush High is still under construction she extended for another year instead of opening the school the end of the year.Charlie couldn\'t help but, felt gleefully over this after she asked his honest opinion over the idea he approved 100% so he\'ll be having patrol officers to help out in Forks High and also told him that the first day is in August 25th not September 5th like it always was and the school schedules are also changed. Instead of starting at 8:10 in the morning it starts at 7:30 in the morning and ends at 5:00 instead of 3:15; when he heard this from Hermione herself stating that she\'s the head principal on both LaPush High and Forks High where they\'ll be meeting at new improve auditorium and to announce it the minute she arrives but, she\'ll be in the background watching as Hermione wanted her uncle to announce this for everyone to know or else they\'ll be consequences meaning if the seniors were to ditch the first day well let\'s just say they won\'t be to graduate; Charlie realize his youngest niece and goddaughter is really terrifying and brilliant at the same time no wonder everyone in school are scared of her. She is pretty powerful for someone so young.Hermione, Jay and Ariel with their families will be arriving in Friday afternoon under 11 hours in Seattle, Washington by now where Charlie Swan will be picking them up personally, so it won\'t be long till they arrive as he couldn\'t wait to see his family again. Ariel and Jay both explained to their uncle Charlie that they\'ll be staying in the \'Black Pearl\' Manor for the time being while fixing up their parent\'s vacation house; Ariel and her husband George with their children Percy II, Esmeralda \'Esme\', Arthur Corey Weasley while Ariel\'s 7 \xc2\xbd months soon to be 8 \xc2\xbd months are having the baby shower will be in Forks that\'s coming up very soon and will be staying there while fixing up the place.Since it was Charlie Swan\'s day off\xe2\x80\x94he drove to La Push reservation to check on the manor since it\'s under the \'Black\' properties he asked Billy to come along since he\'s one of the family members in the Black family household. Charlie Swan headed to pick up Billy and saw Jacob answering the door; he seemed a bit better last time he saw him."Hey Jake," Charlie greeted his godson "How are you feeling?"Jacob gave a small smile "I\'m a bit better chief thanks for asking\xe2\x80\xa6you\'re here for my dad?" he murmured."That\'s good, good I was starting to get worried and yes, I am where is he,""Yeah dad\'s at the kitchen so how is she Mia I mean?""Oh okay and Mia\'s good, happily married and has kids on her own,""Really," Jacob widen his eyes in surprise "Isn\'t she only the same age as \xe2\x80\xa6 Sam\xe2\x80\xa6 though?"Charlie lips twitched in amusement "Yes, she is and it\'s a long story maybe when she arrives to Forks you can ask her about it. I\'m sure she\'ll be happy to tell you,""The next time she comes home I think I will it\'s been a long time since I last saw her, I miss having her around" Jacob chuckled "Come on in chief dad\'s in the kitchen having some breakfast,""Thanks Jake," Charlie beamed as he got inside where he heard Billy from the kitchen "And I\'m very sure she misses you and Seth the most but, don\'t tell Sam or Leah huh?" he explained.Jacob chuckled "Secret\'s safe with me chief," he grinned at this feeling a bit better that his childhood best friend Hermione Potter \'nee Granger is now coming home but, what he didn\'t realize is that she\'s going to change his and Seth\'s life forever."Good," Charlie beamed at this as he sat down on the couch "So how you been these days Jake?""Oh you know been studying in school I managed to get enough credits to work at the Auto Shop with dad and got myself a new motorcycle,""Really? Which one?""Harley Davis it\'s an old motorcycle I\'ma fix it up,""Nice that\'s a best one out there huh," Charlie grinned as they started to chatting away "What about school? Are you thinking of going to college?""I am I\'m thinking of going to Seattle University that Rae went too and she\'s ecstatic to show me around since she got a job there,""Really?""Yeah she\'s excited,""Jacob who\'s at the door?" Billy called from the kitchen."It\'s only Charlie dad," Jacob answered.Billy rolled over to the living room to see his best friend and his son chatting away "Charlie, you\'re here early I thought we weren\'t meeting up till lunch,""Yeah that was the plan but, apparently, I got a call from Mia last night," Charlie beamed at this sipping his beer "And she just informed me that her plans have changed that instead of coming here next week she\'s coming tomorrow it must\'ve crossed her mind because she\'s been too busy packing everything,""Really," Jacob perked up with happiness "Mia\'s coming home?""Yeah she is she was supposed to come next week but, changed her flight plans and coming home tomorrow,""Really that\'s awesome," Jacob grinned "Seth is going to be so excited he\'s been talking about her non stop all week it\'s a little annoying but, he always had a soft spot for her in his heart,""Like you didn\'t have a soft spot for her either Jake," Charlie pointed out.Jacob sighed tiredly "You can tell too\xe2\x80\xa6 huh chief?""You made it kind of obvious and it\'s not every day I have my godson have a crush on my little niece I think that\'s good though\xe2\x80\xa6 after what Mia went through?""What do you mean?"Charlie steadied his breath "I-I think Mia should tell you\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s not really my story to tell,"Jacob frowned "Is she okay?""She\'s fine\xe2\x80\xa6 being a single mother, widow with nine children tends to keep her busy,"Jacob nearly choked on his drink that both his dad Billy and Charlie had to pat him on the back not wanting him to choke "Wh-wh-what \xe2\x80\xa6 n-n-n-nine children," he squeaked as his eyes bug out in shock "She has nine kids,"Charlie and Bill blinked his eyes "A-are you okay and uh\xe2\x80\xa6 yeah? Did-did I not mention that Jake?""No I mean yes I\'m fine but, I meant\xe2\x80\xa6 I always thought she would have two kids at least""Nah\xe2\x80\xa6 no two kids\xe2\x80\xa6 she actually has five kids-quintuplets \'quints\' which made her quite stunned when she and Harry learned about the pregnancy and then her best friend Ron and his wife apparently Susan, Ron\'s wife was expecting quadruplets \'quads\' that same year as Hermione did-the kids are 2 hours apart from each other-James, Seth, Lily, Evie and Henry Potter being born first then the Rose, Daisy, Amelia and Hugo Weasley it was before they were killed though\xe2\x80\xa6and in their will stating that Hermione Potter gained full custody over their kids which is quadruplets \'quad\'s three girls and a boy-so technically they\'re all nine kids,""Whoa...that\'s-that\'s a lot of kids and what do you mean she\'s a widow? What happen to Harry?" Jacob began to say clearing his throat noticing Charlie had a grim sad look while his dad Billy looked confuse "What?" he asked causing Charlie to pat Jacob on the back."Like I said I\'ll let Mia tell you it\'s her story Jake,""Charlie\xe2\x80\xa6 what happened to Harry?"Charlie sighed patting Jacob on the back "Mia should tell you what happen to Harry it\'s her story Jake\xe2\x80\xa6and don\'t worry she\'s fine,""Are you sure?""I\'m positive,""Then why can\'t you tell me about Harry\xe2\x80\xa6 he didn\'t\xe2\x80\xa6 abandon her and the kids did he?""No.. he didn\'t abandon her they were very much in love for a long time actually,""If he didn\'t abandon her then what happen to him?""I want to tell you Jake I really, really do but, it\'s quite sensitive for Mia to talk about\xe2\x80\xa6 when she\'s ready to tell you...don\'t pity her she doesn\'t like that at all and let\'s just say she\'s not the same person that you, Seth, Leah and Sam once knew as a child\xe2\x80\xa6and let\'s leave it like that,"Jacob grew quiet with a slow nod "Okay\xe2\x80\xa6I\'ll leave it alone\xe2\x80\xa6 for now but, how did she-I mean I know how I just-why didn\'t you tell me this before\xe2\x80\xa6 I could\'ve helped her\xe2\x80\xa6 ""You never asked me and you know Mia she doesn\'t like anyone meddling into her business especially in her family she\'s quite private like that,""I can see why\xe2\x80\xa6that\'s understandable and-hold on \xe2\x80\xa6 " Jacob paused for a moment realizing something "Did-did you just say Mia\'s coming home," he began to say causing Charlie to nod at this that Jake turned to the calendar "When?" he asked."She\'s coming in Friday,""Friday," Jake cried out turning to the calendar causing him to pale "That\'s in two days from now!?""Yeah I know last minute change but, she insisted on coming home...she said that she misses us and got a little impatient and there you go,"Billy choked in his tea "Hold on 2 days," he squeaked in surprised looking at the calendar "The surprise party isn\'t set until next week why does she want to leave in 2 days in Friday?!""Yeah I know but, she insisted we can change the dates it\'s not too late to have it tomorrow instead of next week Billy,""Can we do that?""Yeah we can do that in fact you don\'t have to worry about the party Ariel took care the arrangements that\'s set for tomorrow,""Really? How did she do that so fast?""She knows people besides she doesn\'t really want a party,""Are you kidding it\'s not every day we get to see Mia not since her wedding-hold on I got a better idea instead of a party why don\'t I make a big celebration at the bonfire I bet she would love that,"Charlie chuckled knowing his best friend "Alright, alright you can have the bonfire but, really Billy you don\'t have too," he weakly protested."I know I don\'t have too but, she\'s my goddaughter besides Ariel and Jay being my godson if it wasn\'t for Jay \xe2\x80\xa6 Harry wouldn\'t be here with us\xe2\x80\xa6 we owe him Charlie..."It brought them quiet causing Charlie to sigh "Your right ... " he nodded at this "Okay you can have a surprise homecoming Bonfire cookout just for Mia but, that\'s all I don\'t want anyone to find out I mean Bella doesn\'t even know she\'s coming""Why should she know they don\'t get along with each other remember," Jacob began to say shivered at this "The last time they saw each other\xe2\x80\xa6 Bella ruined her \xe2\x80\xa6 party when Mia got accepted to a boarding school in Scotland remember and \xe2\x80\xa6 they been in each other\'s throats since then," he explained.Charlie chuckled bitterly "Yeah.. I remember it was when I yelled at Renee\xe2\x80\xa6told her off stating that I didn\'t want Bella to come visit Forks anymore\xe2\x80\xa6ruined the whole surprise for Mia\xe2\x80\xa6 and Bella hasn\'t came home since until-she was 15 years old\xe2\x80\xa6 and you know the rest \xe2\x80\xa6 and trust me \xe2\x80\xa6 they have a long history of hating each other and I\'m pretty sure once they saw each other it\'s only the beginning of \xe2\x80\xa6 World War III and let\'s just say \xe2\x80\xa6 Edward better watch out... ""What makes you say that? It\'s not like Mia \xe2\x80\xa6 went to war or something right\xe2\x80\xa6" Jacob chuckled thinking it\'s a joke and notice Charlie and Billy grew quiet "Right\xe2\x80\xa6? I was kidding it\'s only a joke" he murmured."Right.. " Charlie nodded at this "Mia go to the war not very likely\xe2\x80\xa6she\'s too much of a classy lady to go to war I should know..." he chuckle weakly."Uh\xe2\x80\xa6 okay\xe2\x80\xa6 so \xe2\x80\xa6 what time is she coming in Friday?""I would say\xe2\x80\xa6 around 12:00 p.m. sharp,""Awe man," Jacob pouted at this realizing he got school "I\'ll be in school\xe2\x80\xa6when she comes home..." then turned to his dad with an idea "Hey dad can I come along with you and Charlie to pick up Mia at the airport," he begged with puppy dog look."Oh no\xe2\x80\xa6 you\'re not going to miss school Jacob even Mia would kill me for that and I rather not get in her bad side thanks,"Jacob pouted with his shoulders slumped "Awe\xe2\x80\xa6 please dad it would really\xe2\x80\xa6 really\xe2\x80\xa6 make me happy just for one day please,""I don\'t know\xe2\x80\xa6.if Mia found out she\'s going to tell me off and she\'s rather scary when she wants to be isn\'t she Charlie,"Charlie chuckled awfully amuse "Yeah she probably would I mean I wouldn\'t mind but, school comes first Jake it\'s not like she\'s going anywhere,""I know but, I really want to see her please dad I\'ll make up my homework when I get back to school in Monday please since I don\'t usually have homework in Friday anyway pleaseeee,"Billy lips twitched seeing his son anticipating to come along "Well\xe2\x80\xa6 I suppose you could," he began to say causing Jacob to perk up "Okay, okay, you can come with us in Friday at the airport to pick her up and well I do need your help to set the party I\'m throwing for Mia and then you\'re coming straight back to school in Monday deal?""Deal," Jacob grinned "Thanks dad," he cried out happily cheering \'Whoo\' jumping upstairs happily causing them to chuckle."What was that about?" Charlie asked.Billy shakes his head "I have no idea but, apparently he\'s excited to see Mia," he grinned knowing his son "You know I wouldn\'t mind if they started dating\xe2\x80\xa6 then we\'d be in law\'s," he explained."Aren\'t we already ...in-law\'s Billy?" Charlie raised his eyebrow at his best friend who blinked his eyes owlish "Considering I married your sister Aaliyah in our unknown past \xe2\x80\xa6 not even your kids know about that or Bells," he explained."You know\xe2\x80\xa6 I kinda forgot about that," Billy grumbled under his breath "Until you mentioned it,""YOU FORGOT?!" Charlie cried out.Billy gave a sheepishly look "Yeah\xe2\x80\xa6 it must\'ve cross my mind since... it has been a long time since I thought about England you know that\xe2\x80\xa6" he began to say with a serious look "So \xe2\x80\xa6 what brought Mia to change her flights to Friday instead of next week anyway?" he explained passing Charlie his beer."Yeah that is true but, apparently the paparazzi won\'t stop following her every move," Charlie grumbled knowing the press "I never liked the press not even the Daily Prophet they\'re nothing but, trouble," he explained not noticing that Jake came back with new clothes who got confuse and joined them because curiously got the best of him.Jacob however got confuse "What do you mean the paparazzi was following her every move Charlie?" he asked causing his dad and Charlie to jump in surprise."Bloody hell.." Charlie held his chest "Jake don\'t do that\xe2\x80\xa6 you scared me\xe2\x80\xa6you nearly gave me a heart attack I\'m getting old for this" he steadied his breath while Jake wince and gave a sorry look "And it\'s a long story son\xe2\x80\xa6 let\'s just say\xe2\x80\xa6 she\'s uh famous where she\'s from?""Sorry I didn\'t mean to scare you Charlie but, doesn\'t she live in England though?""She does\xe2\x80\xa6 you know how her parents are dentists and everything?""Yeah\xe2\x80\xa6""Well\xe2\x80\xa6 my sister is very good with what she does\xe2\x80\xa6 being a dentist," Charlie lied; he felt a little guilty but, didn\'t want to spoil the secret."Oh\xe2\x80\xa6" Jacob grew quiet tilting his head with a shrug "So they pretty much follow her every move because of her parents being a dentist,""Yes but, not because of her parents being dentist it\'s more like Hermione got herself job working with the government and ... the paparazzi would follow her ever move because of it...she\'s quite famous on what she does working with the president and all,""Oh...a little weird but, okay I\'m not a big surprised I knew she\'d save the world one day but, hey at least she did something good. I knew she would be... " Jake sighed grabbing his things "Well, I\'m going to head out now dad meeting up with Sam and the guys,""Alright son see you later oh since you\'re heading over there do you mind giving this letter to Harry it\'s urgent will you,""Sure, dad I\'m on my way to get Leah and Seth anyway,""Perfect thanks Jake,""Of course, dad,"Once Jacob left until he was out in the clear where Billy looked at his best friend Charlie weirdly "The paparazzi still following her eh?""Yep,""Is it that bad down in England,"Charlie sighed sipping his beer "From what Ariel told me it\'s not too bad but, in the Wizarding World where your little niece being famous part of the \'Golden Trio\' to kill a mad man during the Wizarding War that happened five years ago who killed the Potter\'s, and everyone else we cared about yes. Yes, they\'re following her wanting a one-to one interview which she refused you know Mia" he explained."Bloody hell\xe2\x80\xa6.that must be annoying following her every move especially for Mia being so young fighting in the war\xe2\x80\xa6 I can\'t even imagine how hard that was for her,""You have no idea Billy but, the good news is that they don\'t know about how Harry and Hermione got married when they were still students in Hogwarts had a small ceremony\xe2\x80\xa6 or that they have kids, they kept that to themselves since then,""Kids eh? How many?""Five kids quints originally,""Quintuplets you mean five little ones how old are they?"Charlie rubbed his chin in thought "I would say \xe2\x80\xa6 five years old\xe2\x80\xa6 they\'ll be turning six in August and they\'re pretty smart can talk pretty well""Wow must\'ve kept her busy huh? Boy or girl and what\'s their names the kids?""Yes, they do but, she\'s a natural with them I can tell they love their mother very much as much as they love their father Harry," Charlie nodded at this "Three boys and two girls\xe2\x80\x94James Sirius \'Jamie\', Seth Oliver, Harrison Jacob Daniel \'Henry\', Lillian Rosalie Taylor \'Lily\' and Evelynn Sophia Carson Potter \'Evie\' for short and then I wasn\'t sure if you heard my conversation Jake but, Ron and Susan\'s kids are now a Potter because Hermione adopted them into her family so technically it\'s nine kids,""Seth Oliver and Harrison Jacob Daniel eh?" Billy chuckled "Seth and Jake would be honored to be named after her sons and I remember considering that\'s a lot of kids," he explained."She always loved the name Seth and Jacob but, wanted to name after her grandfather\'s from both sides of her parents being named them, she thought it would bring them close to her heart,"Billy whistled at this "Damn that must\'ve been hard to see her love one gets killed like that,""It was but, Harry and Hermione got through it all she\'s stronger than she looks you know,""I know," Billy nodded at this knowing his goddaughter "So what\'s the plan though? What exactly did Mia say?" he explained."She told me that she found a manor called the \'Black Pearl\' apparently Sirius gave her a huge amount of money, assets etc when he died, owed her his life twice before he got himself killed again so she\'s pretty much well off for the next couple of years and you remember where it is don\'t you since Sirius came here when he was on the run we never heard from him again after he went back to England something about his godson Harry," Charlie rubbed his chin in thought "Who happens to be the one that Mia married apparently Harry is Sirius godson imagine that apparently you two are distant related in the family tree and after what happen to my sister and brother in law died thanks to the drunk driver and killed them instantly from a car crash they pretty much gave everything to Hermione, Jay, Ariel with their children, most of Emma\'s things are now mine including the money so I\'m pretty much well off as well\xe2\x80\x94I also forgot to mention that Sirius left you some things too Billy money, assets even old photos when we were kids." he explained."Really?" Billy began to say who seemed surprised by this "And yes I remember where it is? Why do you ask?""Well Hermione\'s going to live there since it\'s a huge property and they\'re going to extend their houses around the property, build a village around the place in the reservation for all of us, you, me, Harry and Sue for all four of us while the kids have their own place too it would be great," Charlie explained.Billy chuckled "I bet it will but, I don\'t think I can ever leave this place Charlie it holds so many memories\xe2\x80\xa6" he drifted off sadly knowing his wife Sara is a sensitive subject "How big is the property,""Pretty huge\xe2\x80\xa6 650,000 acres wide and long up the cliffs would be the backyard down to the townline that\'s how big it is,""Bloody hell...that\'s like the whole reservation and half of the town huh?""Yeah it is\xe2\x80\xa6 but, I bet Sara would\'ve want you to move on with your life and be happy\xe2\x80\xa6Billy I know Liyah and the kids would\xe2\x80\xa6" Charlie whispered.Billy nodded knowing Charlie "Yes, I think your right Charlie\xe2\x80\xa6 maybe it\'s time we did something for us for a change,""Exactly and maybe\xe2\x80\xa6I don\'t know\xe2\x80\xa6 we can even adopt a kid or two?" Charlie offered."Adopt a kid? Aren\'t we a little old for that\xe2\x80\xa6" Billy asked.Charlie chuckled "We\'re never too old to adopt a kid Billy besides don\'t you miss having a little critter around to teach them stuff I know I do since I never got to see Bells grow up that\'s all thanks to Renee\xe2\x80\xa6." He murmured.Billy grew quiet he did have to admit he\'s right\xe2\x80\xa6 he did miss having little ones in the house since Rebecca living so far away in Hawaii with kids on her own, Rachel with Paul, and his only son Jacob he missed having to teach kids the ropes especially fishing."You know what Charlie\xe2\x80\xa6 you\'re right we should definitely adopt a kid or two hell if there\'s more than one kid I wouldn\'t mind either way. I bet my kids would love that \xe2\x80\xa6 wouldn\'t they?" Billy asked."Of course, they would Billy I bet Jacob would love to have a little brother who could look up to him," Charlie offered.Billy beamed "Yes, yes I think he would too,""Then let\'s do it\xe2\x80\xa6 we should talk to Harry and Sue I bet they\'ll be in board too,""Let\'s call and ask them now so we can consider foster care or the orphanage who wants to be adopted,""Sure also Mia told me it\'s hidden and said only a family member of the Black\'s can see it so I assume it would be you since Sirius is your cousin so I\'m pretty you can see it better than I can,""I remember where it is. It\'s the one that Sirius stayed when he was in the run and in hiding remember? It must\'ve been hidden quite well if it\'s by the cliffs," Billy rubbed his chin in thought "So have you ever been in the manor before and it\'s called the \'Black Pearl\' eh\xe2\x80\xa6 you know what I think I know a shortcut to head over there; Mia\'s right about the manor being close to the beach since it\'s 2 miles up north up the mountains,""That\'s exactly what Mia said we should check it out but, I also got a phone call from Ariel as well she said that one of her friends Aqua with a couple of friends are remodeling the manor as we speak they\'re almost done with it actually,""Really?" Billy seemed stunned but, not a bit surprised "I can see why, I\'m only worried about how Sam and the others going to react over this,"Charlie sighed tiredly swearing under his breath in French "Damn\xe2\x80\xa6 I knew I forgot something\xe2\x80\xa6 speaking of Sam and the pack\xe2\x80\xa6 I got to tell you something Billy," he explained."What? What is it?""It must\'ve crossed my mind but, \xe2\x80\xa6 uh Hermione knows\xe2\x80\xa6""Knows\xe2\x80\xa6.what exactly\xe2\x80\xa6""About Sam and the pack being shapeshifters\xe2\x80\xa6 Leah\xe2\x80\xa6 Jared\xe2\x80\xa6 Paul\xe2\x80\xa6 Jacob\xe2\x80\xa6 Seth\xe2\x80\xa6 Embry\xe2\x80\xa6 Quil\xe2\x80\xa6 Brady\xe2\x80\xa6 Collin\xe2\x80\xa6 she knows\xe2\x80\xa6 and the Cullens being vampires. Ariel told her what happen including Jay and I mean everything,"Billy winced at this knowing his youngest goddaughter bad temper being the mama bear of her childhood friends "Everything eh? How much of everything,""Every\xe2\x80\xa6 single detail\xe2\x80\xa6 she knows about the Cullens being vampires\xe2\x80\xa6 she knows about Sam and the pack being shapeshifters\xe2\x80\xa6 pretty much everything that Bells been doing while toying and using Jacob\'s feelings Billy the minute she started living with me in Forks"Billy whistled and winced at this knowing his goddaughter Hermione "Even Sam and Leah\'s break up,""Uh huh\xe2\x80\xa6""Does she know about the \xe2\x80\xa6 ""Imprint not yet as far as I know Ariel was discreet with the details\xe2\x80\xa6she had to make a small tiny lie that Sam cheated on Leah with Emily when we both know that\'s not why they broke up""If she doesn\'t know then-" Billy paled at this realizing that her goddaughter isn\'t going to be happy "Oh \xe2\x80\xa6fuck\xe2\x80\xa6 just imagine how Mia is going to feel when she learns the truth," he explained."Billy the girl is terrifying even I\'m scared of her and she\'s my youngest niece. She also knows about the Volturi involved, how Victoria created an army wanted revenge against my daughter thus winning the battle thanks to Jay and his recruits without Sam, the pack and the Cullens finding out; that\'s how muchMia knows considering how powerful she is\xe2\x80\xa6 I mean her husband Harry defeat Voldemort in the war including Hermione and Ron with the rest of the light side...that\'s how powerful they are,""Sweet mother of Merlin\xe2\x80\xa6 I can see why Sirius doesn\'t like to be in her bad side and she\'s only my goddaughter she\'s even terrifying than her mother Emma when she was a kid eh?""Where do you think she inherited from? Danny nahh being a mama bear is from Emma while for Dan he just goes along with it,"Billy chuckled knowing Dan then frowned "Hold on\xe2\x80\xa6 does Mia know about your daughter\xe2\x80\xa6 toying and using my boy?""Trust me Billy she knows about that too\xe2\x80\xa6you remember how I told you that she\'ll help Jake move on that\'s when she knew about the whole story between them and I mean everything that she made the whole city including the manor she was staying shaken that\'s how powerful she is and she\'s only 25 years old,""I thought she\'s 23 years old though,""She would be\xe2\x80\xa6 if it wasn\'t for the time turner but, no\xe2\x80\xa6 she aged 2 years ahead than her original age\xe2\x80\xa6 she\'s not the same little innocent girl that that we watch grew up Billy.. I\'m really worried about her,""What do you mean is she okay?""Oh Billy\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s \xe2\x80\xa6 bad\xe2\x80\xa6 like really bad you remember how I was when I lost Aaliyah and the boys\xe2\x80\xa6""Yeah\xe2\x80\xa6""It\'s like that except much, much worse,""You\'re kidding,""Nope... ""What \xe2\x80\xa6 exactly happened?""Even for me it\'s hard to talk about\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s \xe2\x80\xa6 terrible that I can\'t form any words for it,"Billy stared at his best friend and decided to change the subject as he can tell that Charlie looked devastated by the news "You know\xe2\x80\xa6the day Mia was born I knew she was going to change the world\xe2\x80\xa6" he began to say causing Charlie to look up Billy all confuse "And for Mia to say that she\'s going to help my son Jacob to move on from being toyed and used by your daughter she has my respect she always has so I\'m not a bit surprised she would say that," he explained."Mia\'s temper you mean?""Yeah\xe2\x80\xa6 I\'m not a bit surprised when it comes with Mia she always been the overprotective mama bear towards Sam, Leah, Rae, Rebecca, Jacob, and Seth\xe2\x80\xa6 but, when it comes with your daughter\xe2\x80\xa6 " he sighed sipping his beer "That\'s a whole different story\xe2\x80\xa6 I\'m not even going to be surprised that Bella isn\'t afraid of the girl no offense to you Charlie but, your niece being my goddaughter is brilliant\xe2\x80\xa6 very brilliant but, bloody terrifying like Emma.. when she was her age\xe2\x80\xa6 like mother like daughter," he explained.Charlie chuckled sipping his beer "Trust me I know\xe2\x80\xa6 and I\'m not even a bit offended she\'s exactly like my sister oh and before I forget Jay named his sons after my sons from my first marriage\xe2\x80\x94Logan Matthew, Zander Maxwell Niel, Charles William Jr II \'CJ\' named after the both of us and his two friends from school then there\'s little Sophia who\'s named after Maliyah\'s little sister who passed away by giving birth to her twin daughters Arianna and Hannah then before the girls were born they also have a set of twin boys Newton and Nelson so Jay and Mal adopted them and became a part of their family so basically Jay has about \xe2\x80\xa6 eight children altogether with Mal then Ariel with her husband George has five children\xe2\x80\x94then Hermione she has \xe2\x80\xa6 nine children," he explained.Billy however choked on his beer "Nine children," he squeaked causing Charlie lips twitched in amusement "You\'re kidding-" he began to say causing Charlie to shake his head "I thought you were just joking on that," he explained."No I wasn\'t joking I was being serious, Mia has nine children, Jay has eight children while Ariel she has six children-Ariel is 7 \xc2\xbd months expected triplets two boys and a girl-her eldest is Percy, then Emery and Arthur then the three little ones,""Really\xe2\x80\xa6?""Yep,""That\'s \xe2\x80\xa6 a lot of kids\xe2\x80\xa6""I know\xe2\x80\xa6and guess what?""What?""We\'re also their uncle grandpa to those kids?""Really?""Yes, really we\'re all uncle grandpa\'s, uncle grandpa Charlie, uncle grandpa Billy, then uncle grandpa Harry and then nana Sue,""Why is Sue known as nana Sue and not nana auntie Sue?""Well it sounds like a mouth full when you say it,""Oh," Billy pondered for a moment nodding to himself "So we\'re all uncle grandpa\'s to those kids,""Yes sir,""Bloody hell I\'m honored that I\'m actually an uncle grandpa me\xe2\x80\xa6 an uncle grandpa... that\'s really sweet of them to consider us into their family,""Well yeah we\'re family BIlly you know that,""I know\xe2\x80\xa6 I just\xe2\x80\xa6 didn\'t realize\xe2\x80\xa6 it was getting to that point where I\'m going to be an uncle grandpa and who knows maybe my kids will make an actual grandpa,""I have no doubt about that Billy,""But, I do have a question though?""Shoot?""Why so many kids no offense to Mia or anything?""None taken the last four Rose, Daisy, Amelia and Hugo are Ron and his wife Susan\'s kids, their parents were instantly killed from raid of death eaters 3 \xc2\xbd years ago killing everyone in sight while Ron\'s family-The Weasley\'s they were killed burned alive at the Burrow\xe2\x80\xa6 killing everyone\xe2\x80\xa6 Arthur\xe2\x80\xa6 Molly\xe2\x80\xa6 their children\xe2\x80\xa6 Bill\xe2\x80\xa6 their eldest with his wife Fleur with their kids\xe2\x80\xa6 Percy\xe2\x80\xa6 his wife Audrey and their kids\xe2\x80\xa6Ginny with her husband Seamus with their children then their friends Dean with his wife Hannah who was expecting their first child-their all dead Billy...the only one who survived is Charlie, Fred and George who were at work when they found out they lost their entire family,""No\xe2\x80\xa6" Billy looked heartbroken over this as he\'s good friends with Arthur and Molly Weasley with their kids which Charlie nodded sadden "How? Why didn\'t we know about this before?" he explained."From what Ariel told me\xe2\x80\xa6 it was pretty hard \xe2\x80\xa6 Jay and Mia been through so much\xe2\x80\xa6 they haven\'t took the news well\xe2\x80\xa6 Ariel had to watch over George and Fred who were depressed while Charlie dealt with his own grief with Jay and vice versa then there\'s Mia\xe2\x80\xa6 " Charlie closed his eyes sadly recalling the news from his niece Ariel who called him crying not knowing what to do to help "It took two years for them to slowly heal from everything\xe2\x80\xa6 I can\'t even imagine\xe2\x80\xa6 how hard that was for Mia\xe2\x80\xa6" he explained."Fuck\xe2\x80\xa6 no wonder you couldn\'t even form any words when Jake asked you\xe2\x80\xa6""I know and there\'s a reason for that\xe2\x80\xa6 because it\'s still sensitive for Mia\xe2\x80\xa6 I didn\'t even find out\xe2\x80\xa6 until Ariel told me \xe2\x80\xa6 a year ago\xe2\x80\xa6 who learned who killed everyone \xe2\x80\xa6 Voldemort\'s inner circle of death eaters that attacked the Burrow, use a powerful spell to trap them\xe2\x80\xa6 by burning them alive\xe2\x80\xa6 so Hermione had to \xe2\x80\xa6 cremate them in ashes\xe2\x80\xa6 their buried in a private cemetery that they protected it with powerful wards\xe2\x80\xa6 that same day Billy\xe2\x80\xa6 it was when they were attacked in St. Mungo\'s\xe2\x80\xa6 I guess they must\'ve been planning the whole thing\xe2\x80\xa6 wanding revenge against my niece Hermione, her husband Harry Potter and Ron Weasley for killing Voldemort and winning the war\xe2\x80\xa68 years ago""Bloody hell poor Mia\xe2\x80\xa6 the poor kid\xe2\x80\xa6""Believe me I was as shocked as you were when I heard the news from Jay and Ariel when they told me this back then\xe2\x80\xa6 Hermione didn\'t really handle well she became \xe2\x80\xa6 an empty shell with no emotions\xe2\x80\xa6 but, she\'s slowly healing\xe2\x80\xa6the only reason she\'s still where she is now is because of the kids that left her to keep fighting for the kids sake...as far as what they told me anyway\xe2\x80\xa6""That\'s terrible and Harry\xe2\x80\xa6 what happened to Harry\xe2\x80\xa6""He got killed during the auror mission with Ron\xe2\x80\xa6 Billy\xe2\x80\xa6 who instantly got killed\xe2\x80\xa6 their dead\xe2\x80\xa6 making Hermione a single widow and mother of nine children\xe2\x80\xa6 I didn\'t even know until Jay and Ariel came to visit me last summer during a business trip\xe2\x80\xa6 when I found out\xe2\x80\xa6it took a few hours to calm down Ariel before she can tell me what happen to our friends "Billy stared at his best friend with wide eyes "Are you serious\xe2\x80\xa6but, they been married for nearly... 5 years right?""9 years actually since they got married twice, the first one was when they eloped when Hermione was 17 as she\'s illegal adult in the wizarding world while Harry was 16 then got married again only a small wedding where we got invited thus gain a family and I\'m serious as a heart attack\xe2\x80\xa6 they got married before the war gotten really dangerous they never told anyone about it except the ones who knew""Bloody hell poor kid can\'t get a break from all of that huh?"Exactly what I said,""Does that mean that...Bella\xe2\x80\xa6""No, she doesn\'t know anything she\'s very much clueless when it comes with magic thank bloody Merlin she doesn\'t have any magic\xe2\x80\xa6 she\'s all muggle got that from her mother,""Good," Billy scowled "I never liked that girl\xe2\x80\xa6 she\'s exactly like her mother\xe2\x80\xa6""I know\xe2\x80\xa6. but, she\'s my little girl Billy\xe2\x80\xa6"Billy soften his eyes "I know she is but, she doesn\'t respect you Charlie\xe2\x80\xa6 surely you would know that I mean what kind of person \xe2\x80\xa6 or say daughter called their father by their first name instead of just saying dad\xe2\x80\xa6 father\xe2\x80\xa6 daddy? Etc I mean who does that?"Charlie shrugged at this "Hell would I know,""No one unless they don\'t respect their parents Charlie my kids don\'t even call me by my first name it\'s disrespectful to anyone who doesn\'t listen,"Charlie grew quiet "I know\xe2\x80\xa6 I know that for a long time Billy\xe2\x80\xa6 it just pains me to admit that"Billy put his hand over his best friend\'s shoulder "For someone who got married twice\xe2\x80\xa6 Aaliyah or the kids wouldn\'t disrespect you Charlie\xe2\x80\xa6 and yet\xe2\x80\xa6 your daughter who toyed with my boy\xe2\x80\xa6didn\'t even bother to care\xe2\x80\xa6 that\'s not what any kid should do\xe2\x80\xa6 and if anything... you still got me, Harry and Sue to support you along with the elders no matter what considering we\'re family I\'m always here to listen and help out you know that\xe2\x80\xa6 and you know how you wanted to adopt a kid or two?""Yeah\xe2\x80\xa6""I\'ve been thinking about it for awhile\xe2\x80\xa6 and is the offer still stands?""Yes absolutely does that mean you\'ll be willing too\xe2\x80\xa6?""Adopt a kid or two \xe2\x80\xa6 " Billy began to say with a sigh staring at the house "Absolutely \xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s been so lonely in the house I want to give them a home\xe2\x80\xa6 somewhere they\'d feel safe you think Jake would be up for it?""Are you kidding I\'m sure he would love that...and always wanted a little brother\xe2\x80\xa6 since he has two sisters already," Charlie chuckled "And I would love to have a kid again but, there\'s no room in my house" he frowned at this "Damn\xe2\x80\xa6""Didn\'t you say that Mia is willing to build houses around the property?""I did\xe2\x80\xa6 what are you suggesting?""Why don\'t we\xe2\x80\xa6 build a house to make room for the kids?"Charlie debated this with a nod "I like that idea I think it\'s about time I move to a new house...since I can\'t live in my current house at the moment\xe2\x80\xa6" he shrugged at this "I have a few ideas and I think Mia is willing to negotiate with me,""That\'s true so what do you think Charlie?""I say we do it let\'s adopt a kid Billy if anything\xe2\x80\xa6 maybe this time I\'ll actually have one\xe2\x80\xa6 a real family where there\'s actually laughter inside the house\xe2\x80\xa6it hasn\'t been the same since Aaliyah and the boys got killed...and I thought\xe2\x80\xa6 after meeting Renee I would have a family again\xe2\x80\xa6which I did\xe2\x80\xa6 with Bells\xe2\x80\xa6 but, we were never close no matter how hard I try\xe2\x80\xa6 she wouldn\'t meet me halfway\xe2\x80\xa6 and she\'s always been close with her mother\xe2\x80\xa6 but, with me...it\'s\xe2\x80\xa6 hard\xe2\x80\xa6 I just don\'t why she\'s acting like this\xe2\x80\xa6 and I can\'t even-" Charlie sighed tiredly leaning against the couch which Billy soften his eyes over his best friend "I know she\'s been hurting Jake and I know we made up\xe2\x80\xa6 but, I want to apologize again on behalf of my family for hurting you\xe2\x80\xa6 but, mostly with Jake\xe2\x80\xa6 no one deserves to get hurt\xe2\x80\xa6and I\'m really sorry Billy,""I know you are\xe2\x80\xa6 but, if anything she should be the one to apologize to Jake\xe2\x80\xa6not you since this is her doing because he\'s the one that got hurt\xe2\x80\xa6 she toyed with him, used him \xe2\x80\xa6 stating that she loves him yet she loves that leech\xe2\x80\xa6 that\'s not love Charlie\xe2\x80\xa6 that\'s\xe2\x80\xa6 I can\'t even \xe2\x80\xa6help my own son over this because\xe2\x80\xa6 I feel like \xe2\x80\xa6 I failed him\xe2\x80\xa6 as his dad that I can\'t even protect my own son,""Billy\xe2\x80\xa6 you didn\'t fail him\xe2\x80\xa6 far from it,""No I did\xe2\x80\xa6 fail him\xe2\x80\xa6 if I knew \xe2\x80\xa6 that Isabella was going to toy my son I would\'ve told her to stay away from my family\xe2\x80\xa6 I know she\'s your kid\xe2\x80\xa6 but, I can\'t accept her \xe2\x80\xa6""I know\xe2\x80\xa6 and I get why you would I would\'ve felt the same way if things were reverse\xe2\x80\xa6 and if we\'re going to adopt kids\xe2\x80\xa6 we should grab some brochures over foster kids, orphanages etc\xe2\x80\xa6 I bet Sue can help she always volunteering to help out whenever she could,""I think it\'s about time we both do,""Yeah we do and we should tell Harry and Sue too right,"~*~End of Chapter Fifteen~*~Wow that\'s a long chapter. It\'s already 2:10 a.m. it\'s officially my mom\'s birthday she\'s now 58 years old. Happy birthday mama ! I hope you have an awesome birthday today! Despite how we celebrated all weekend either way I hope you guys enjoy the new chapters that\'s coming up and don\'t worry Hermione and her family are arriving very soon.\nChapter Sixteen: Something\'s Different Today!"Well yeah, they\'re part of the group,""I had a feeling you\'d say that and there\'s something else I have to tell you?""Oh yeah and what\'s that?""Did I tell you who bought the schools?""Schools\xe2\x80\xa6no\xe2\x80\xa6""You know the construction on both schools that\'s been going on around town and everything,""Yeah\xe2\x80\xa6""And the new changes around town that has been happening on and off over the years,""Of course does that mean you know who\'s doing the whole construction thing. It\'s irritating Sam and the pack as it is,"Charlie snorted "Of course I do... " he sighed tiredly sipping his beer "It\'s Mia,""What? Is she okay?""Oh she\'s fine\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s just\xe2\x80\xa6 Mia is the one who\'s in charge of the changers around town \xe2\x80\xa6 the construction in LaPush High she owns the school, Forks High and extending the town to bring more tourist when they travel it\'s all Mia. She\'s the mysterious boss that\'s been making all sorts of changes in this town,""What do you mean making all sorts of changes?""Meaning she\'s making our town better,""Wasn\'t it already better though,""It was a few years ago but, with the killings Mia, Jay and Ariel decided to help out in the background, the shadows being the \'big bosses\' and since Mia owns both schools she told me what\'s going to happen in school,""Like what?""Like you know how the schools usually have the first day in September 5th every year and everything?""Yeah?"Well this year it won\'t be in September 5th \xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s going to be in August 22nd instead,""August 22-" Billy began to say looking at the calendar then looked in Charlie "That\'s in 3 \xc2\xbd weeks from now isn\'t it," he explained."It is which is why Mia is going to portray as a student in disguise no one will expect her to be their new teacher or the head principle seeing she\'s the new boss and if anyone were to be absent in the first day especially the first day they won\'t graduate if they\'re not passing their classes,""Isn\'t that a bit harsh though?"Charlie shrugged "It may be harsh but, Mia, Jay and Ariel are preparing the kids for the real world. Not everything is going to be easy for them especially what\'s been happening right now,""So\xe2\x80\xa6 you\'re telling me that the kids are going to school in August 22nd not September 5th,""Yeah pretty much,""What else is she changing I\'m a bit curious,""Well she upgraded the auditorium into a stadium?""A stadium how?""She knows people\xe2\x80\xa6 you do know she knows people from higher places she is powerful and a heroine in the Wizarding World being the one to destroy \'you know who\' due to her husband Harry,""Yeah your right she is but, why change the schools?""Well that\'s part of her revenge\xe2\x80\xa6 against Bells\xe2\x80\xa6"Billy gave a raise eyebrow "Revenge\xe2\x80\xa6 against your daughter?""Yes\xe2\x80\xa6from what I\'ve been told yes,""What exactly is she going to do?""Since Bells is staying with her mother for the whole summer\xe2\x80\xa6 she won\'t be able to know what\'s going to happen in Forks and since the Cullens are out of town for the whole summer as well \xe2\x80\xa6 neither of them will know the changes and I got a text from Bells last night stating that she\'s going to miss a week of school in the first week since she wanted to spend another week with her friends in Arizona?""Oh\xe2\x80\xa6 but, wouldn\'t she be missing school though since the first day in August 25th not September 5th,""Exactly\xe2\x80\xa6. Bells won\'t know about the changes\xe2\x80\xa6 Mia is keeping herself quiet, watching in the background until Bella and Edward gets back by then everyone will be in school but, Edward and Bella will be missing 2 weeks of school which the policy in school stated that if the students were missing more than two weeks there will punishment-either they make up the assignments they missed or they get suspended for 3 days,""Bloody hell\xe2\x80\xa6 and Mia agreed to that,""Well yes she\'s the principle and the head boss to the school of course she\'s in charge of this,"Billy whistled "Well I\'ll be damn and what else did she change?""Well in the first week the students in Forks High are going to be held in the auditorium where their going to meet the new teachers, staff and the head principle so Sam and the pack along with the Cullens aren\'t going to see this coming at all,""Charlie...I have one thing to say to you,""Oh and what\'s that?""Mia is brilliant but, bloody terrifying remind me not to get in her bad side I mean jeez\xe2\x80\xa6 and how the hell did she change the auditorium into a stadium inside,""Like I said she knows people and we\'re invited to the first day since the parents of the students are going to be there too,""Even the ones from the reservations,""Yep,""Well I\'ll be damn\xe2\x80\xa6 if I didn\'t know any better I would think she\'s a Slytherin under all that Gryffindor pride,""That\'s what everyone keeps telling her. She inherited by her uncle Eric. my brother he\'s always been sneaky, hiding between the shadows, keeps to himself. Sneaky\xe2\x80\xa6 very sneaky\xe2\x80\xa6 and mischief for trouble isn\'t she,""Yes, yes she is...Bloody hell\xe2\x80\xa6 well I hope there\'s popcorn?"Popcorn for what?""You\'re going to see me sitting in the front when Mia shows herself to the town surprising everyone I want to be there to see Sam, the pack, especially the Cullens and Bella\'s reaction when they found out that Mia is back in town being the head boss, their teacher and revealing herself from her disguise,"Charlie chuckled "That makes two of us and you know what?""What?""Let the games begin\xe2\x80\xa6 I can hardly wait until that day comes,"" Me too my friend me too,""It\'s going to give Sam and the pack especially Sam, Leah, Jacob and Seth a bit of a shock when they find out that Mia is back, portraying as a student when she\'s their actually teacher in disguise," Charlie chuckled sipping his beer as he couldn\'t wait to see their reaction "Being their teacher in each of their classes who\'s also their head principle while Jay and Ariel will be the co owners and assistant principals with their friends being thier new teacher in their class no less since she owns the school,""I have no doubt about that\xe2\x80\xa6that\'s some big job for Mia for someone who\'s 23 years old but, uh quick question though?""Shoot?""Since the first day is August 25th instead of September 5th what time does school start,"Charlie grinned evilly "It starts 7:30 in the morning instead of 8:10 in the morning,"Billy gawked at him for a short moment "Why so early?""Gives them a head start on what Mia plans for them if they were late,""And what happens when their late\xe2\x80\xa6""Let\'s just say Mia has some tricks up for her sleeve if there\'s any student who disobeyed those rules. It\'s going to be a strict high school I have no doubt about that,""Bloody hell\xe2\x80\xa6 I would hate to be in Jake, Sam and the pack shoes\xe2\x80\xa6 when they find out,""Oh trust me they aren\'t going to like waking up that early\xe2\x80\xa6 7:30 in the morning is pretty early,""Yeah it is but, how is the rest of the town going to find out about this?""Well since Mia is coming in Friday; I\'m going to be announcing it in town and set the notice letter to everyone about the new changes around town while Mia and her family are watching in disguise,""She can disguise herself?""Yes, she uses the glamour charm a lot keeps her away from the press; she always been good with charms since she can remember,""Let me guess she got that from Emma?""Nope she got that from me," Charlie chuckled causing Billy to gawk at him then chuckled causing them to press their beers together "Trust me Billy they won\'t even expect this happening," he explained."Well then let the games begin," Billy grinned sipping his beer "Hold on if she\'s going to be portraying as a student how will you know it\'s her?" he asked."Oh trust me she\'ll give out small little hints and you\'ll know it\'s Mia,"Billy raise his eyebrow at his best friend "How?""She\'ll give out some hints Billy. You\'ll see what I mean,""Well I can hardly wait to see everyone\'s reactions over this,""Me either and it\'s going to be fun seeing their reactions especially the Cullens,"Billy scowled "Oh don\'t remind me I thought they\'re away for the summer though?""They are but, they\'ll be back within a week after Mia arrives,""Damn \xe2\x80\xa6 I was hoping they won\'t come back,""I know\xe2\x80\xa6 " Charlie sighed tiredly "But, don\'t worry Mia has plans for the Cullens after what she heard what happen\xe2\x80\xa6 she has plans for them trust me,""Like what?""She didn\'t say all she said that she\'s planning something big against the Cullens that they\'ll be in shock over the whole thing trust me you don\'t want to know,""Now I\'m intrigued what she\'s going to do?""Oh trust me Billy when it comes with Mia\xe2\x80\xa6 you don\'t want to be in her bad side especially since Dr. Cullen is her friend; they were co workers back in England 3 \xc2\xbd years ago before the hospital was destroyed. I think it\'s more of a warning towards Edward and his siblings\xe2\x80\xa6 if they were to cause any trouble from what I heard she doesn\'t like Edward or Alice due to how they\'re stirring trouble around town with Bella around,""Oh really \xe2\x80\xa6 does she know that Dr. Cullen is a vampire I do admit I never trusted them but, after Dr. Cullen saved my son he has my respect\xe2\x80\xa6 he and his wife Esme I trust them both but, the adopted kids not so much\xe2\x80\xa6 especially since it\'s causing a lot of tension between two of our clans,""I know\xe2\x80\xa6 like I said Mia is planning something big against them\xe2\x80\xa6 and I wouldn\'t want to be in their shoes she\'s that terrifying Billy,""You don\'t have to tell me twice\xe2\x80\xa6"In the other side of the world, in England late at night not looking at the clock, she turned off the lights and went upstairs to her bedroom checking on her children who were soundly asleep holding their stuff animal; James, Seth and Henry had different animals; James had a stag deer and a black dog the same color and form as his grandfather\'s James Potter and Sirius Black. Henry had different sets of wolves which were sandy brown, rusty brown, jet black, dark silver, brown, chocolate-brown, pale gray with black spotted, light gray, dark ashy brown and reddish brown fur of a werewolf pack; then Seth her other son had a tiger like his father Harry; Lily and Evie both had a Panda Bear and werewolf; sandy brown and rusty brown wolf to be exact.However, Hermione chuckled when the children looked at her with their father\'s green eyes; she couldn\'t seem to say no to her babies so she bought each animal at the gift shop then there\'s Ron and Susan\'s children; her godchildren, who happened to be her babies: Rose, Daisy and Amelia had different sets of tigers, bears, and werewolves as they\'re big fans of them then Hugo his was different kinds of cats\xe2\x80\x94like tigers, lions, cheetahs, puma\'s, etc it was a very eventful day for them.She nearly spends at least $10,000 of food, toys and more toys for the kids and another $10,000 for donation for the endangered animals to help, she smiled kissing her babies on the forehead as they had a big day tomorrow since they\'re leaving England forever\xe2\x80\x94her once home will be forever a distant memory. She laid down after changing into her pajamas and drifted off to sleep the minute her head touched her pillow not realizing that her life will change. Hermione groaned and pulled the blanket over her head when her alarm went off; trying to block the sound but, she knew she had to get ready for her flight and had to get ready; she stretched her arms scanning around her now old bedroom.After few minutes looking at the time it was only 3:10 in the morning she only had two hours of sleep, got out of her bed quickly as she didn\'t have time to think and grabbed her clothes to get ready for the day. Once she was done with her shower she sighed feeling the water against her rubbing off the tension off her neck and back. Twenty minutes later she wrapped her hair into a towel and covered herself with her slick robe which was purple that she bought when she went shopping with Ariel in muggle London a few days ago.Hermione brushed her teeth, did her make up making it seem natural and her jewelry. She looked at the time it was now 4:45 in the morning; it\'s a good thing she already packed her things; all she had to do was take the quints and the kids change from their pajamas after taking their baths and they\'ll be good; She wasn\'t sure if she had time for breakfast. Once she went inside her bedroom the quints and the kids stirred over that she rushed over to see them; James the oldest of the quints stirred up blinking his eyes scanning around reaching his small arms for his mum Hermione who rushed over to pick up her son bouncing him around."Morning Jamie Jam did you sleep well," Hermione murmured.James nuzzled her neck in comfort that left the rest of his siblings to stir away not far away; Hermione sighed putting him down but, he wouldn\'t let go so she picked all of them up not wanting to get them to cry early in the morning since Remus, Tonks and the others were still asleep and didn\'t want to disturb them yet."Morning momma and yes I did," James murmured with a yawn."That\'s good Jamie Jam let\'s get you lovelies a nice bath, so we can get ready and grab something to eat hmm since we\'re going to the cemetery and you get to see your godmothers Aqua and Ruby do you remember them lovely?" Hermione murmured.James being the eldest tilting his head "I have another godmother momma?" he asked."Mhmm\xe2\x80\xa6 Aqua and Ruby are twins luv their good friends with me, your auntie Ariel and uncle Jay back in America?\'"Their twins?""Uh huh do you remember them?"James shakes his head as he couldn\'t remember them much "No momma?""That\'s okay you were really young when you last saw them," Hermione began to say steading her baby boy James staring at the window "Do you remember how I told you that we\'re going away for a little while?" she explained."Yeah I remember you said that I have an uncle grandpa right?" James murmured."Mhmm he\'s my uncle through your nana Emma since that\'s her brother so technically he\'s your uncle grandpa does that makes sense luv?" Hermione murmured.James grew quiet "Kind of yeah are we going to Forks today momma?""We are but, not until tonight,""So we\'re leaving tonight momma?""Yes,""If we\'re leaving tonight\xe2\x80\xa6 then what are we going to do for the rest of the day?""Well today being our last day we\'re going to spend the whole day together after I\'m done with the adult stuff that I have to do,""What are we going to do momma?""Well since yesterday we went to the zoo and had a party I thought we can go to the carnival and spend the day with our family until we leave to the airport what do you think luv?""A carnival what\'s a car-car-carnival?""It\'s like a fair where there\'s all sorts of things we can do in muggle London I saw the ads in the billboards when we were leaving heading home last night,""Oh\xe2\x80\xa6" James titled his head "Is it fun momma?""It\'s loads of fun Jamie Jam and all our cousins with all our friends are going with us,""Really even Scorpius, and his brothers, Leo, Ali along with the rest of our friends,""Uh huh it\'s going to be a large group and then we\'re going to be leaving around midnight today,"James being the eldest titled his head "Why?" he murmured."We\'re leaving England to live in Forks that\'s all the way in America it\'s a small town where we\'re going to start fresh luv and you get to meet your uncle grandpa he\'s going to be so excited to see you. He hasn\'t seen you since you were just a little baby," Hermione murmured.James blinked his eyes owlish "Is he nice momma?"Hermione nodded at this "Your uncle grandpa is awesome Jamie Jam, not only he\'s your uncle grandpa but, he\'s your godfather too and he gave you loads of toys when you were just a baby and do you remember that scrapbook that I used to read to you when you were really young. Do you remember that wolf stuffed animal that you\'re carrying?""Yeah?""That\'s from your uncle grandpa he gave you that,""He did," James blinked his eyes looking at his favorite toy "Even those other toys momma?" he asked looking around his room."Yes that\'s all him well some of them anyway and I added all sorts of photos inside do you want to see?""Cool\xe2\x80\xa6 and okay momma,"Hermione smiled grabbing the scrapbook from her beaded bag putting her whole arm while steadying James onto her lap "Now where\'s that thing ah-hah found it," she grinned grabbing the scrapbook revealing a red and yellow scrapbook with a lion on the front "Here we go... look this is from my wedding with daddy this is when we got married," she explained.James blinked his eyes owlish showing his teeth "Daddy that\'s daddy" he murmured."Yes luv that\'s your daddy doesn\'t he look handsome and look he\'s smiling,""Daddy\xe2\x80\xa6" James whimpered as he grew quiet alreadying missing his dad which Hermione noticed "Who\'s that momma?""That\'s you luv when you were born look," Hermione began to say showing the baby revealing James Sirius Potter being held by Harry "He was so happy that day luv the day you were born was the proudest moment of his life both of our lives\xe2\x80\xa6 then there\'s your brother Seth Oliver Cameron Potter being born next then your two sisters Liliana Luna Rosalie Potter \'Lily\', Evelynn Sophia Carson Potter \'Evie\' and then my youngest baby Harrison Jacob Daniel Potter \'Henry\' you guys are the best thing that ever happen to your father and me," she explained."Really?" James murmured."Yes Jamie Jam we both love you guys so, so much and your father will love you just as much just because he\'s not with us that doesn\'t mean he won\'t look after us from heaven," Hermione began to say noticing her eldest son James grew quiet "What\'s wrong luv?""Nothing momma?""Are you sure\xe2\x80\xa6 you know you can tell me anything right?""I know momma \xe2\x80\xa6momma?""Yes Jamie Jam?""Do you believe in angels?"Hermione blinked her eyes dumbly wasn\'t expected that steading her baby boy James onto her lap "Well\xe2\x80\xa6 yes \xe2\x80\xa6 I do why do you ask luv?""Do you think daddy\'s an angel\xe2\x80\xa6 watching over us from heaven with the rest of our family who lost their lives?""Yeah I really do love\xe2\x80\xa6 he\'s our guardian angel\xe2\x80\xa6they all are""Are you sad mama?""What makes you think I\'m sad sweetheart,""Daddy gone, uncle Ron\'s gone, auntie Susan, auntie Gin, uncle Bil, auntie Fleur, nana Molly, grandpa Arthur, uncle Percy, auntie Audrey are all gone\xe2\x80\xa6 our cousins are gone\xe2\x80\xa6 do you miss them because I miss them very much,"Hermione face fell and sighed kissing her son\'s forehead "Yes, sweetheart your daddy\xe2\x80\xa6 your uncle Ron and everyone else are gone\xe2\x80\xa6 but, I\'m not sad sweetheart since I miss them too very much,"James stared at his mum "Mommy I know you miss daddy, uncle Ron and everyone else too we miss them too\xe2\x80\xa6" he then climb on her lap staring at her with a serious look "And you know what mummy?""And what\'s that sweetheart,""I bet daddy would want you to be happy because I want you to be happy we all do so please\xe2\x80\xa6 be happy mommy. I don\'t like when you get sad,"Hermione blinked her eyes owlish holding her baby boy James "I know you do sweetie but, that doesn\'t mean I\'m going to be sad all the time and I\'ll try to be happy for you guys \xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s just one of those things that I have to do and deal with on my own,""You still have us mommy. I\'m still here," James murmured."I know you are sweetie and I appreciate that baby," Hermione murmured."Mummy?""Hmm?""Do you love daddy mummy?""With all my heart sweetheart if it wasn\'t for him I wouldn\'t have you guys or get married to your daddy because I didn\'t believe he would\'ve loved me like I did with him but, he did we fell in love Jamie Jam,"James gave a small smile "I\'m glad you married daddy mummy he\'s the best daddy in the world even if he\'s not with us anymore I know he\'s watching over us \xe2\x80\xa6 just like uncle Ron and auntie Susan are watching over Rosie, Daisy, Amelia and Hugo right mummy?""Well\xe2\x80\xa6yes they all are \xe2\x80\xa6 they\'re all our guardian angels\xe2\x80\xa6 considering they\'re your uncle Ron and auntie Susan\'s kids yes\xe2\x80\xa6 I supposed if they were still alive they probably would\'ve lived with us but, considering I\'m their godmother it\'s my job to raise and look after them as they\'re part of our family\xe2\x80\xa6 ""Did you adopt them mummy?""You know I did Jamie Jam since you were there when I adopted them officially in our family so technically I have nine children together luv are you okay with that being the big brother to nine siblings Jamie Jam I thought you loved being a big brother,""I don\'t mind being a big brother to many brothers and sisters mummy they\'re my family," James beamed at this as he held her very close."Well of course they are we\'re a big family Jamie Jam," Hermione chuckled at this kissing his forehead "I love you Jamie Jam,""I love you too mummy," James murmured."Momma\xe2\x80\xa6" Henry murmured causing Hermione to rush over to her youngest son while holding James into her arms."Henry boo mummy\'s here I\'m here..." Hermione began to say kissing his forehead that was until they both turned to see Seth, Lily, Evie, Rosie, Daisy, Amelia, and Hugo woke up not far behind from James and Henry; she had to sigh and steady them it was hard at first but, she got the hang of it "Oh look Jamie Jam the whole gang is awake they\'re just in time for breakfast hmm?" she murmured."What are you going to make momma?" James asked."How about my favorite cinnamon waffles?" Hermione told him."Yum," James beamed at this as the kids nodded eagerly "With extra strawberries right momma?""Anything for you Jamie Jam come on let\'s go see if the others are awake huh?" Hermione offered.James, Seth, Lily, Evie, Henry, Rose, Daisy, Amelia and Hugo nodded at this causing Hermione to chuckle knowing her kids as they headed downstairs to the kitchen; the children being in their pajamas all chatted away wanting waffle waffles which Hermione agreed to make sure and decided to make breakfast only to see Charlie, Tonks and Remus up early preparing breakfast. Charlie who smiled greeted his little sister but, blood."Morning little one," Charlie greeted his sister and ruffled the kids well mostly the boys while Lily, Evie, Rosie, Daisy and Amelia were still tired nuzzling their mum\'s neck "They seem tired are they ready for the carnival today,""Morning Charlie," Hermione greeted him with a hug well tried anyway as she\'s carrying her nine children steadying them in her arms "And yes they are but, it\'s still early to go to the carnival and-" she noticed Remus, Tonks and Teddy headed downstairs "Oh morning papa Remus, morning mama Tonks and good morning Teddy bear,""Good morning Mya," Remus and Tonks greeted her."Morning auntie Minnie," Teddy yawned at this "Are we going to the carnival yet?""Not yet Teddybear it\'s still early,""Awe...how long do we have to wait?""Not for awhile,""Boohoo\xe2\x80\xa6""So what\'s the plan today Mya?""We still have to transfer everyone\'s burials to Forks and it should be there when we arrive in Forks tomorrow,""That quick eh?""Mhmm,""How long does the flight usually take to arrive to Forks anyway?""11 hours mostly,"Charlie gawked at her "11 hours\xe2\x80\xa6 you\'re kidding,""Nope,""And how are we going to get there?""Airplane?""What\'s an airplane?"You know when you guys fly the broom up in the air?""Yeah\xe2\x80\xa6""Well it\'s kind of like that except we go inside an airplane that holds a lot of people and would take you anywhere you want,""Really?""Uh huh,""Bloody mental I rather just take the broom and fly there,""I figured you say that which is why this is muggle airplane we\'re going as muggles Charlie we have to blend it with the muggles remember,""Oh right," Charlie sighed at this "I remember Jay told me this but, I expect it to be in a muggle airplane," he explained.Before Hermione can answer that\'s when Luna, her husband Draco with their children Scorpius, Lysander and Lorcan in their pajamas still asleep "Morning," Luna perked up."Morning," Remus, Tonks, Teddy, Charlie and Hermione grinned taking a cup of coffee "You\'re awfully early Lulu,"Luna sighed happily "I couldn\'t sleep well so I thought why not just go to Mia\'s house since I know she has coffee and breakfast ready for us to arrive," she beamed at this "And I was too excited to go to the carnival," she explained.Draco however, grumbled under his breath "Just two more months\xe2\x80\xa6 two more months," he murmured."Morning Draco, morning Scorpius are you excited today?""Morning," Draco murmured grabbing his coffee "I hope you don\'t mind us coming over early,""I don\'t mind at all you know you\'re always welcome here," Hermione told him setting him a plate of his his breakfast with Luna sitting next to him with their children sitting on their laps.Scorpius gave a tired yawned "Morning...where we going auntie Minnie?" he asked."We\'re going to the carnival before we leave to America tonight," Hermione murmured."What\'s-what\'s a carnival?""It\'s a fair filled with rides, games and loads of food that you\'re going to love,""Like what?""Well there\'s a ferris wheel where you get to see the whole view of the city and then there\'s other games that they\'ll have,""Oh\xe2\x80\xa6 what time are we going to the carnival?""Around the afternoon?""What time is it now?\'Hermione lips twitched looking at the cloak "It\'s now\xe2\x80\xa6 6:30 in the morning Scorp,"Scorpius pouted "How long will that take?""About six hours luv\xe2\x80\xa6"He scowled turning to Luna sipping her tea "Momma you woke me up for nothing," he huffed; he\'s a bit cranky in the morning he inherited that from his father Draco."No I didn\'t sweetheart we were already planning to see your godmother today since we\'re going to transfer\xe2\x80\xa6 a few things today before we head to the carnival and leave to America tonight,""And you couldn\'t wait until later momma?""Well don\'t you want to play with your friends?"Scorpius huffed "Yes but, they\'re probably asleep and where\'s James?""He\'s awake and eating breakfast would you like some?"Scorpius yawned "Might as well\xe2\x80\xa6 momma woke me up early," he murmured, Draco set his eldest son down to join his friends "Morning Teddy, morning Jamie, morning Seth, Lily, Evie, Henry, Rose, Daisy, Amelia, Hugo, what are you guys eating?""Morning and we\'re eating breakfast want some?" Rose offered."This is really delicious auntie Minnie makes the best waffles ever," Teddy cried out happily."Don\'t eat with your mouth full Teddybear,""Sorry," Teddy swallowed his food "This is delicious as always,""Your welcome teddybear,""You should make this all the time," Teddy cried out causing Hermione to giggle as she nodded at this as she promised she would."Of course Teddy bear I\'ll be sure to buy loads of ingredients to make cinnamon waffles," Hermione winked causing Teddy to perk up.Scorpius shrugged at this "Sure\xe2\x80\xa6 what is it?""Waffles,""What\'s waffles?"Rose shrugged at this showing her waffles "This is waffles, momma Minnie made it it\'s really good try it Scrop,""Okay\xe2\x80\xa6" Scorpius tilting his head curiously got the best of him, he inherited from his dad Draco and tried a mini cinnamon waffles as his eyes wide in awe "Mmm\xe2\x80\xa6 this is really good auntie Minnie made this Rosie?" he explained."Uh huh it\'s our favorite thing to eat for breakfast,""It\'s my favorite too, momma can you make this?"Luna lips twitched "Of course baby," she turn to Hermione "Mione do you mind giving me the recipe on the waffles?""Of course Lulu, it\'s not that hard to make really," Hermione murmured grabbing a notebook and wrote the recipe down "Here you go,""Thank you," Luna perked up and grab a piece giving an approval \'hum\' "He\'s right it is delicious and Penny approves," she giggled fondly rubbing her stomach.James yawned "Mooooooo-" *yawns* "Mooooor-" *yawns* "Morning,"Scorpius lips twitched "You look tired than I am James?""Well my momma woke me up today said that we\'re going to the carnival later and that we\'re going to visit my daddy,""Your daddy?""Yeah\xe2\x80\xa6 we\'re going to visit him?""Oh\xe2\x80\xa6am I going too?""I think so\xe2\x80\xa6"While the kids were chatting away that\'s when Neville and his husband Blaise arrived not that long with their children twins Leo and Ali who looked a little cranky coming over in the morning "Morning all," Blaise greeted his friends."Morning," Hermione and the others greeted Blaise, Neville and the kids "You\'re just in time for breakfast," she explained."Morning Ali, morning Leo," James and the kids greeted their friends.Leo yawned rubbing his eyes being tired "Morning\xe2\x80\xa6 " he yawned as his head was leaning against his daddy\'s shoulder "Whatcha guys eating?""Waffles,"Leo blinked his eyes all confuse "What\'s waffles?""This is waffles Leo my momma Minnie made it this morning, it\'s really good," Daisy beamed munching away her waffles."Oh...can I try some?""Sure\xe2\x80\xa6 here you go?""Thanks\xe2\x80\xa6"Blaise and Neville set their kids on the bench for them to eat munching quietly leaving their parents quite amuse "What do you say to your aunt Hermione and what do you think of the waffles?"Leo munching away looking at his godmother "Thank you for the waffles auntie Minnie and It\'s really good\xe2\x80\xa6 it has this sweet taste \xe2\x80\xa6 what is it?""Cin-cin-" Rose scrunched her nose looking at Hermione "Momma what is the sweet flavor called again?""Cinnamon luv and your very welcome Leo?""Oh\xe2\x80\xa6 Cin-cinnmon?""Close enough Rosie,"Rosie giggled knowing how smart she is "Momma can you make this every day?"Hermione lips twitched "I\'ll see what I can do Rosie,""Goodie," Rosie clapped her hands excitedly as they ate their waffles quietly while the adults head to the living room "Look Leo you can add syrup on top,""What\'s syrup?"Daisy started chatting about syrup causing Leo to tilt his head "Cool.." he murmured causing the adults to laugh.While Hermione and her family were having the time of their lives at the carnival, the other side of England was a small town-Forks; you would think it\'s just a muggle town but, it\'s not really; there\'s magic filled in the air-the Cullens being vampires while Sam and the pack being shapeshifters would be enemies-as tension filled in the air thanks to Bella\'s rash decisions but, we\'re getting ahead of ourselves here. Sam and the pack were patrolling so Jake was a bit impatient for Hermione\'s arrival at the moment."Hey Sam, hey guys sorry I\'m late," Jake answered."It\'s fine don\'t worry about it," Leah assured him causing Jake and the pack to look at her oddly which she noticed "What?""Nothing\xe2\x80\xa6"Leah rolled her eyes "Whatever, let\'s just get over with since some of us have work the next morning and kept changing the fricking patrol schedules again!?" she snapped and huffed patrolling the left side.Sam sighed tiredly "Seth you and Jake go with Leah in the left side, Paul, you, Embry and Quil go in the right side while I\'ll go with Jared in the south and north,""What about us?" Brady asked."Yeah,""You and Collin\xe2\x80\xa6 will go with Paul and the others okay,""Awe man again?""Don\'t start with me Paul don\'t even start with me,"Paul grumbled under his breath "Yeah, yeah, yeah come on pups let\'s get this over with,""We\'re not pups,""Oh yes you are, I\'m older wiser and did this longer than you guys have so therefore your pups got it,""Fine\xe2\x80\xa6""Come on Paul let\'s just get over with,"In the other side of the woods-Jake, Leah and Seth were patrolling checking the perimeter until they were alone where Leah decided to speak up."Hey Leah\xe2\x80\xa6wait up,""Hurry up!"Jacob and Seth sighed tiredly as they followed Leah to the left side of the woods "Did you see anything?""Nope everything is clear in this side\xe2\x80\xa6 let\'s check this part of the woods,""Yeah sure\xe2\x80\xa6"[in the other side of town\xe2\x80\x94Forks High] \xe2\x80\xa6Sam and the pack were currently in school keeping their distance from everyone especially the Cullens it\'s a good thing that Jake, Seth, Paul, Embry, and Quil were the AP classes instead of regular classes but, Biology was the only class that Jake has with Edward and Bella much to his annoyance."Hey Sam what\'s up?""Not much\xe2\x80\xa6" Sam began to say sipping his coffee "Did you feel it?"Jake raise his eyebrow at Sam "Feel \xe2\x80\xa6 what exactly?""There\'s something different in the air\xe2\x80\xa6 I can\'t explain it\xe2\x80\xa6 but, it\'s different?""You mean you felt it too?""Yes, I did\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s been happening for awhile\xe2\x80\xa6 I thought it was just nerves but, it\'s not\xe2\x80\xa6""So what do we do?""I\'m not sure\xe2\x80\xa6 yet but, I\'m sure it\'s nothing for us to worry about it since the Cullens are out of town for the whole summer?""The whole summer?""Yep from what Dr. Cullen told us anyway he said that his children are away they should be back next week in the latest,""Oh really\xe2\x80\xa6?""Yes,""And he just told you?""We bumped into each other this morning at the restaurant I was just getting some coffee and he was finishing his errands for the day,""That\'s cool\xe2\x80\xa6" Jake shifted uncomfortable which Sam noticed "Umm\xe2\x80\xa6.there\'s something I have to tell you?""Tell me what?""Apparently my dad told me that \xe2\x80\xa6 uh Mia is coming home?""You told me that already,""No I mean she change her flights instead of coming home next week she\'s coming \xe2\x80\xa6 uh\xe2\x80\xa6 Friday,""Friday?""Yes\xe2\x80\xa6""Which Friday?""Tomorrow?""TOMORROW?!""Yes\xe2\x80\xa6""Why wasn\'t I informed this before,""You never asked me\xe2\x80\xa6""But, how did you know that she\'s coming home tomorrow,""Charlie came to visit and told me along with my dad\xe2\x80\xa6 and I\'m also going to accompany them to pick up Mia at the airport,""You\'re WHAT?!""Uh huh my dad said I can miss school today I don\'t have any tests this week so it\'s fine,"Sam gave a blank look "You\'re kidding,""Nope so you and the rest of pack are stuck in school while I\'m going to grab Mia at the airport," Jake told him with a smug look."Why do you look so smug about it?""Do you have any idea how long it\'s been since Mia\'s been home,""She hasn\'t stepped foot in Forks since she was 13 years old,""I know,""And now all of a sudden she\'s coming,""Well yeah\xe2\x80\xa6 things were \xe2\x80\xa6 complicated,""Complicated\xe2\x80\xa6""Yes,""And how do you know this?""Charlie told me,"Sam gave a blank look and then tired sigh "Right\xe2\x80\xa6 of course he did\xe2\x80\xa6 speaking of news\xe2\x80\xa6 I just found out that the school is opening in August 22nd not the 25th in August,""How come?""They said the boss switched the grand opening of the school their nearly done and everyone\'s is excited what the new changes in Forks High has now. I heard they build a stadium inside,"Jake stared at Sam with a weird look "A stadium you mean like where they host American sports in each season kind of thing,""Yep,""How is it going to fit in Forks High?""It\'s not just in Forks High they\'re also building one in LaPush High from what I heard,""How did they manage to do that,""Apparently the new boss is pretty rich so \xe2\x80\xa6 ""That\'s a lot of work under 3 weeks,""Yep,""I wish we were back to our old school,""I know\xe2\x80\xa6 it wasn\'t like we had a choice Jake,"Jake sighed at this "Yeah\xe2\x80\xa6 I know stupid football players," he grumbled."Come on man let\'s get out of here classes is about to begin,""Way ahead of you man\xe2\x80\x94" Jake paused for a moment "Hey uh Sam\xe2\x80\xa6""Yes\xe2\x80\xa6""Do you have any idea how are you going to explain to Mya about the uh \'break up\' between you and Leah\xe2\x80\xa6 since she has no idea that you guys are together she\'s going to be so confused by how you\'re dating Emily instead of Leah\xe2\x80\xa6" Jake murmured.Sam pause and froze to his spot "Oh shit\xe2\x80\xa6 I forgot about that,""You forgot?!""Well I had other things in my mind to \xe2\x80\xa6 think about \xe2\x80\xa6the break up\xe2\x80\xa6 you know that\xe2\x80\xa6""Right\xe2\x80\xa6""You don\'t think that\xe2\x80\xa6 Leah would tell Mya do you\xe2\x80\xa6?""Considering Leah was one of the bridesmaids in Mya\'s and Harry\'s wedding five years ago I would assume so they\'re like sisters to each other while we were the groomsmen since Harry didn\'t have enough guys in the wedding party so Mya added us into the group,"Sam swore under his breath "Ah shit\xe2\x80\xa6 Hellcat\'s going to kill me when she finds out,""And then she\'s going to kick the rest of us for not telling her sooner you know how protective she is with Leah \xe2\x80\xa6.""She\'s also protected with you and Seth mostly you two since you\'re the babies,""Right\xe2\x80\xa6 but, we\'re not babies anymore\xe2\x80\xa6 we\'re in high school,""I know\xe2\x80\xa6 I know\xe2\x80\xa6considering me and Hellcat are the same age yes I would say so,""I thought she was Leah\'s age,""No she\'s my age\xe2\x80\xa6 she just acts a bit older than the rest of us you know how motherly Mya can be,""True\xe2\x80\xa6 true\xe2\x80\xa6mostly with me after\xe2\x80\xa6 what happen to my mom\xe2\x80\xa6."Sam had a sad look "I know\xe2\x80\xa6 at least your dad\'s here with you Jake \xe2\x80\xa6 you would\'ve been raised by Charlie\xe2\x80\xa6 if anything happen to both your parents\xe2\x80\xa6 you know that don\'t you?"Jake flinched at this "And thank god for that\xe2\x80\xa6 ""Hmm\xe2\x80\xa6it would\'ve been fine if you didn\'t tell her what we are Jake,""I only gave her clues I didn\'t really tell her anything\xe2\x80\xa6I\'m just glad she\'s not my .. well you know\xe2\x80\xa6""I\'m sure you\'ll find your \xe2\x80\xa6well you know,""When?""I have a feeling you\'ll find em soon Jake just keep your head up at least you know now it\'s not Bella\xe2\x80\xa6 ""Yeah \xe2\x80\xa6 thank god for that,""Well if anything she wasn\'t that pretty,"Jake snorted "So I heard\xe2\x80\xa6""From\xe2\x80\xa6?""Everyone in the pack and I\'m pretty sure blondie over there would\'ve agreed," Jake murmured nodded at the Cullens which Rosalie lips twitched at this which she gave a salute which he returned the favor."What was about that?""Me and Blondie held a truce\xe2\x80\xa6 sort of\xe2\x80\xa6""When did this happen?""A few days ago\xe2\x80\xa6 you were wrong though?""About what?""That Rosalie, Emmett, Alice and Jasper were coming home next week since they\'re right there,"Sam gave a blank look "But, that\'s what Dr. Cullen told me though,""Well maybe he didn\'t know\xe2\x80\xa6 and besides\xe2\x80\xa6we held a truce with each other the blonde and I anyway after we tried to get the red hair leech a few days I just didn\'t want to inform you guys\xe2\x80\xa6 that\'s all..."Sam furrowed his eyebrows "And why wasn\'t I informed to this before?"Jake shrugged at this "I didn\'t think it was a big deal\xe2\x80\xa6 she helped me realize that Bella wasn\'t who I thought she was that\'s all\xe2\x80\xa6 ""We been telling you that for months and when we finally thought that you\'d move on I have to find out that she helped you heal when we\'ve been trying to help you move on from Bella since then,"Jake shifted uncomfortable "And I appreciate that but, you guys weren\'t exactly helping especially Paul," he began to say causing Sam to sigh tiredly "Besides she\'s right though\xe2\x80\xa6 Rose helped me realize that\xe2\x80\xa6 you guys were right \xe2\x80\xa6 she helped me move on a little bit at least for me anyway\xe2\x80\xa6""But, you\'re okay though right?""Yeah.. for now\xe2\x80\xa6""So what are you going to do when Bella gets home,"Jake shrugged at this "I\'m not going to care because\xe2\x80\xa6 ever since I had that talk with Rose\xe2\x80\xa6 I was starting to move on a little bit\xe2\x80\xa6""Really?""Yeah\xe2\x80\xa6.""That\'s great Jake I\'m glad you\'re slowly moving on from this and you know if you need anything just know that we\'re always here if you want to talk,""Thanks Sam I appreciate that,""Of course,""So uh how did you manage to move on from Bella anyway\xe2\x80\xa6?"Jake shifted uncomfortable "Well\xe2\x80\xa6I\'ve been getting these \xe2\x80\xa6 dreams\xe2\x80\xa6 ""Dreams\xe2\x80\xa6?""Yes\xe2\x80\xa6 and it\'s always the same dream over and over\xe2\x80\xa6 it would show this brunette girl with these amazing chestnut eyes\xe2\x80\xa6 she would hide her smile\xe2\x80\xa6 her pain\xe2\x80\xa6 the agony\xe2\x80\xa6she was heartbroken and the minute she met me\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s like she\'s slowly moving on too\xe2\x80\xa6 and get this\xe2\x80\xa6 Seth was in it too,"Sam blinked his eyes owlish "Seth\xe2\x80\xa6 as in Leah\'s brother Seth,""Uh huh it was really weird,""And then what happen?""Well\xe2\x80\xa6 we were happy \xe2\x80\xa6 everyone was there\xe2\x80\xa6 we were on the bonfire \xe2\x80\xa6 and my dad was introducing me to someone that I haven\'t seen in forever and\xe2\x80\xa6 apparently we know her,""We do?""Yes we do,""Who?""I didn\'t get to see who she looks like because that\'s when I woke up,""Oh...what do you think it means?""I have no idea...do you think\xe2\x80\xa6 their\xe2\x80\xa6 trying to tell me something\xe2\x80\xa6 like why would Seth and I be happy to see her?""I\'m not sure\xe2\x80\xa6 maybe your dream is trying to tell you something \xe2\x80\xa6 like there\'s something different in the air\xe2\x80\xa6 maybe it\'s a sign\xe2\x80\xa6 that danger is coming\xe2\x80\xa6""Danger is coming really Sam?""Well considering what\'s happening I wouldn\'t be surprised\xe2\x80\xa6 but, I wouldn\'t worry about that dream of yours it\'s just a dream ya know\xe2\x80\xa6""Yeah \xe2\x80\xa6 maybe\xe2\x80\xa6""Does uh Leah and Seth know about Mia coming?""No not yet\xe2\x80\xa6 I only told you since we\'re all best friends with her\xe2\x80\xa6""Right\xe2\x80\xa6""And who knows\xe2\x80\xa6 maybe Mya can help Leah heal from the messy break up between you two," Jake muttered under his breath as he headed inside the school leaving Sam quiet.Sam sighed at this "I hope so\xe2\x80\xa6 I really hope so\xe2\x80\xa6""Sam Uley?"Sam froze and turned around seeing Tai with a raise eyebrow "Yes\xe2\x80\xa6?""This is for you?""What\'s this?""Apparently you\'re going to meet the new boss tomorrow,""Tomorrow?""Mhmm she\'s coming tomorrow?""The boss is a she?""Yes\xe2\x80\xa6""What\'s her name?""Anastasia\xe2\x80\xa6 Anastasia Potter,""Anastasia Potter\xe2\x80\xa6 are you sure?""Quite positive considering she owns both Forks High and LaPush High so she\'s the big boss in this entire town\xe2\x80\xa6 and her uncle being the head chief approvals,""Hold on \xe2\x80\xa6 Chief Charlie knows Anastasia?""Of course it\'s his niece,""Niece?""Mhmm\xe2\x80\xa6good day to you Sam Uley,"Sam was about to answer but, when he turned to see Tai, he was gone causing him to blink his eyes owlish "What the hell\xe2\x80\xa6is going on in town" he muttered under his breath.In the other side of the town-well, across America is England, London a secret world of the Wizarding World where you\'ll see Hermione Potter, Draco and Luna Potter, Blaise and Neville Longbottom-Zabini, Jay Granger, Charlie Weasley, Fred and George Weasley with his wife Ariel Weasley at the cemetery transferring the burials of their families who passed away. They\'ve been working from the past 4 \xc2\xbd hours making sure everything is fine."Mio are you sure you want to do this?" Aqua asked.Hermione steadied her breathing looking at the cremated jars of Arthur, Molly, Bill, Fleur, their kids, Percy, Audrey, their kids, Ginny, Seamus with their kids, Dean and his wife Hannah who was expecting their first baby ashes inside with their names in the front along with her late husband Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, his wife Susan Weasley, Sirius Black, James and Lily Potter; the list went on."Yes I\'m very sure like I told you on the phone\xe2\x80\xa6 I\'m not willing to risk leaving them behind especially with death eaters who can use dark magic over them...I rather have them safe in my hometown where they\'re safe and can be in peace...as if they always been,"Aqua nodded silently "Alright\xe2\x80\xa6" she began to say giving a signal to Yukiyah, Johnny, Jax, and Robb who nodded as they muttered a spell and transferred them into Forks, Washington inside Hermione\'s property-The Black Pearl where they\'ll be buried close to home "They should be in Forks within a few hours before you head home tomorrow,""Brilliant\xe2\x80\xa6 are you sure it\'s perfectly safe and their burials are next to my parents burials?""Yes, it\'s perfectly safe and we made sure there\'s a lot of room next to your parents burials since it\'s under your names," Ruby slowly nod at this gathering the forms "All we need is your signature and they should be there, it should be completed to look like as it was before within 5 \xc2\xbd hours," she explained.Hermione looked at the forms signing her signature Hermione Potter and felt the wards turn off as everyone in the cemetery are now gone is now an abandoned cemetery "Good\xe2\x80\xa6I want you to make sure to put powerful words around the cemetery back home and I\'ll set the password when I get there including Jay\'s late wife Mal and his sister in-law Sophia right?""That\'s fine and Jay should be the one to sign on behalf of his wife and sister in-law,""Jay?""Hmm\xe2\x80\xa6""We need you to sign this,"Jay looked at the forms and signed his signature "Done,""Thanks Jay,""Of course Aqua thank you for helping us transfer our family close to us,""Anything for you guys, you know Harry and the others have always been a family to me since we been in school,""Hogwarts forever,""Always,""You okay Jay?"Jay gave a slow nod at this "I will be you?""I\'ll be alright\xe2\x80\xa6come on let\'s go find the others,""Sure,""Aqua?""Yes?""Did you did that thing that I asked you to do back home?"Aqua grinned "It\'s already done,""Are you sure\xe2\x80\xa6?""Oh yes\xe2\x80\xa6 the stadium that you upgrade in the schools is now finished we just need to finish the classrooms and add more sports centers; it should be good to go,""Perfect, thank you what about the Police Academy and the R.O.T.C. buildings is it done too?"~*~End of Chapter Sixteen~*~Whew I\'m on a roll today! Updated 3 chapters under 24 hours (lol) and for those who asked Hermione and her family arriving to Forks-very soon! Right now it\'s Thursday morning in England so they\'ll be leaving around midnight to the airport from the carnival being their last day and they\'re going to spend the day together with Kingsley and his kids. It\'s going to be very epic ^_^\nChapter Seventeen: Last Day In England!"The one in Forks High is now finished but, now they have to finish the second one in LaPush it should be finished by the end of the month and then we\'ll add the swimming pool, sports center in both schools, along with the courses for the students,""And the offices?""They\'re all done Mio,"Hermione gave a \'hum\' sound looking at the blue prints "I have a position that I want to ask you Aqua?""Anything Mio?""I\'m sure you heard that I\'m going to build a magical school within my property I was hoping you and the guys are willing to help me and my friends to build it with us,""I would love too and I\'m sure the guys are willing to help too,""Perfect and I also need you to send these out to my uncle Charlie he\'ll know what to do since I just send the new notice of the new school year, signing the forms and it should be announced in the first day in school. The new school year in Forks High will start in August 22nd 2011 not September 5th 2011. The school will start in 7:30 in the morning sharp and it will end at 5:00 p.m. anyone who disobeyed this rules \xe2\x80\xa6 there will be consequences especially for the seniors in high school if they don\'t follow or participate in the school \xe2\x80\xa6 they won\'t be able to graduate or have enough credits to graduate if they miss more than 2 weeks of school and for the students who were transferred from LaPush to Forks High their school is extended to another year since I\'m thinking of building more projects around the school so it should be done for another year got it,""Oh really?"Hermione chuckled "Yes...when my family and I arrive to Forks\xe2\x80\xa6 my second name is going to be Anastasia Potter," she began to say causing Aqua to chuckle "And I\'m going to be under a glamour charm until the first day of school I\'ll be revealing my true identity," she explained."Always the mischief for trouble aren\'t you Mio?" Aqua chuckled "Even after all these years that hasn\'t changed one bit huh?" she explained."Oh I\'ve changed but, none of my friends have no idea how much besides\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s not just Sam and the pack, the Cullens have anything to worry about \xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s more like Isabella\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s going to turn her world upside down\xe2\x80\xa6 imagine her reaction when she finds out that not only I\'ll be her teacher in all eight classes but, the head principal in both Forks High and LaPush High being the big bad boss\xe2\x80\xa6 the one who\'s in charge either or not she\'ll graduate in high school\xe2\x80\xa6 the mysterious boss that happen to drop by in her home town no less she has no idea\xe2\x80\xa6who she\'s dealing with," Hermione explained with a harden expression.Aqua shivered "Has anyone ever told you that your bloody terrifying Mio,""Yes\xe2\x80\xa6 yes they have,""Well they were right you\'re really terrifying\xe2\x80\xa6 and I never liked your cousin anyway after what she did to poor Jacob,"Hermione sighed tiredly sipping her wine "Yes\xe2\x80\xa6 and I have big, big, big, big plans for Isabella and her little vampire family\xe2\x80\xa6 despite the fact that I know Dr. Cullen\xe2\x80\xa6 it would seem we\'re going to have a problem if his adopted son is involved with my dimwitted cousin \xe2\x80\xa6 I just hope it wouldn\'t come to that \xe2\x80\xa6 considering he should know how powerful my husband Harry, our best friend Ron and I are," she explained."I think everyone in the Wizarding community does Mio you\'re a hero,""I\'m hardly a hero\xe2\x80\xa6 I killed people\xe2\x80\xa6""Which they\'re death eaters\xe2\x80\xa6 they\'re the bad guys who killed innocent people including your parents\xe2\x80\xa6"Hermione held her breath "I know\xe2\x80\xa6 and I\'m glad I killed them\xe2\x80\xa6 the death eaters who deserved to die but, that doesn\'t mean I have to like it,"Aqua gave a slowly nod at this "Of course\xe2\x80\xa6 anything else you want me to add?""Nope that\'s all for now I\'ll owl you if we think of any plans for the upcoming projects around town,""Of course see you at home Mio,""See you at home Aqua,"Aqua apparate with a soft \'pop\' leaving Jay and Hermione by themselves as they headed off to meet up with Draco, Luna, Charlie, Fred, George, Ariel, Blaise and Neville who were chatting among themselves double checking with the list to leave behind inside the Black vaults and keep it there."Hey how was it?" Ariel asked."It was good they just transferred everyone in Forks, Washington next to mum and dad it should take within 5 \xc2\xbd hours to complete the task to look as it was before with powerful wards and everything,""I\'m glad it all worked out Mia,""Me too\xe2\x80\xa6so did you got the list?""I do," Luna nodded at this passing her the list "This is the list that we all decided to leave behind in the vaults," she explained.Hermione gave a smile looking at the list "Perfect\xe2\x80\xa6 do you have it with you?""I do everything inside my bag,""Can I have it please,""Of course,"Hermione looked inside the bag looking at the frames, old furniture, the books from the Black Library that she wasn\'t going to bring-that was out of harm way away from the children "Brilliant," she then turned to Draco "Draco do you mind going to the bank and put this in the Black vaults since it\'s on your way to the office please?" she explained."You can count on me Mia," Draco nodded at this "I needed to go to the bank anyway,""For what?""To check on last minute things," Draco began to say while Luna looked at her husband with a raise eyebrow which he noticed kissing her on the forehead "Relax luv I just want to double check with the gobins about something that\'s all," he explained."Well\xe2\x80\xa6 alright\xe2\x80\xa6 do you and Blaise want to meet us at the manor when you\'re done or at the carnival?""I think we should meet at the manor since I have no idea where the carnival is besides in muggle London,""That\'s fine and do you mind going to the shop to get some snacks please,""Of course luv anything else?""Can you get chips on the way?"Draco sighed at this "Fish & Chips?""Yes?""It\'s already on the list anything else?""Green tea?""Green \xe2\x80\xa6 tea?""Yes,""Anything else?""Powder donuts, and I want all different flavors of teas especially peppermint?""Anything else?""Lots of donuts I heard it\'s rather delicious,""Of course\xe2\x80\xa6 anything else?""Well I was hoping you\'d buy me this\xe2\x80\xa6" Luna began to say whispering something to Draco who coughed awkwardly "And maybe \xe2\x80\xa6 a bit of this\xe2\x80\xa6" she whispered."Ri-right\xe2\x80\xa6 I\'ll uh ask Mia to do that luv,"Luna pouted "Why can\'t you do it?""Well for one I\'m not familiar with that,"Luna pouted "Oh right I suppose your right," she sighed tiredly causing Draco to raise his eyebrow "I want some chocolate?""Chocolate?""Yes it has to be a pacific chocolate?""What kind of chocolate do you want luv?""White chocolate, white chocolate with raspberry truffles, white chocolate, chocolate, milk chocolate with nuts, milk chocolate with berries, white chocolate with fillings and milk chocolate,""That\'s \xe2\x80\xa6 a lot of chocolate,""Well it\'s not my fault that our unborn daughter is craving for chocolate Draco,""Ri-right umm is that it then?""No there\'s more," Luna began to say grabbing her list out of her purse revealing a long list causing Draco to bug out "We also need to buy muggle clothes, school supplies for our boys, also we need to get new furniture for the boys including you since we all need some but, we can do that when we go to Forks," she explained.Draco gawked at his wife then gave a slowly nod "Yes dear,""Oh and Draco?""Yes\xe2\x80\xa6?""I just want to let you know that we\'re also going to drive a muggle car, a motorcycle and a boat,""A boat\xe2\x80\xa6and a car?""Yes apparently Mia\'s uncle Charlie is taking us fishing when we arrive there and Mione will be teaching us how to drive a car since Sirius left her his motorcycle when he passed away back in 5th year and during the year in her 6th year Mione got her license on both car, boat, and motorcycle so it\'s legal for her to drive whenever she wants even thought her uncle is the head chief it\'s best to follow the laws there don\'t you think?""Of course dear\xe2\x80\xa6 anything else?""That\'s it thank you luv,""Anything for you,""See you back at the manor and be careful will you,""I always am luv\xe2\x80\xa6 come on B\xe2\x80\xa6 we have some \xe2\x80\xa6 business we have to get back too after the bank huh?""Sure," Blaise kissed his husband Neville who happily oblige "I\'ll be back luv see you at the manor,""Okay and be careful both of you,""Always am?" Blaise saluted his husband as he and Draco both aparate to Diagon Alley to head to Gringotts Bank "Did you get everything in the bag that Mia left behind to put in the vaults,""Yeah it\'s in here," Draco explained."Brilliant and then we can go to the office to take care of things right?""Right,"In the other side of the world was America-a small town in Forks, Washington where Charlie Swan was setting everything up as he got some help from his nephew Jay\'s friends Taichi. He was settling up the stadium and had his two best friends Harry Clearwater and Billy Black to help out well seeing the stadium inside the school."Is that it Harry?"Harry drove inside the parking lot of Forks High with a nod "Yep I see Charlie in the front come on old man," he offered.Billy rolled his eyes "Oh ha, ha, ha old man am I then you\'re a kid," he jokingly says.Harry snorted "Yeah and pigs will come flying out of my butt," he flatly says causing them to chuckle."Harry, Billy you guys made it," Charlie happily exclaimed helping his best friend Billy\'s wheelchair "What do you guys think? It\'s nearly done," he explained."What is it?""A stadium inside the school isn\'t it great," Charlie cried out."It looks small?""Looks can be deceiving Harry remember that,""What do you mean?"Charlie grinned "Hey Tai can I have the remote I want to show my two friends is that okay?"Tai who turned around with a grin "Of course chief anything for Headmistress Potter\'s favorite uncle," he beamed at this."Oh stop," Charlie waved it off "Little Lion should be the one who should be praising not me,""Trust me Chief everyone in the world is but, you know Mio,"Charlie nodded at this "Yes, yes I do little lion always been the private one especially in her life,""Mio?" Harry asked all confuse "Who\'s Mio?""It\'s Mia it\'s her nickname come on I want to show you guys something?" Charlie offered showing his friends inside the office."Whoa\xe2\x80\xa6" Billy and Harry murmured as they\'re both in awe; as the school of Forks High everything has changed; the classrooms, the teacher staff everything it was completely changed."Mia did all this How?" Harry asked."You know Mia," Charlie shrugged at this "Sam and the pack doesn\'t know about this or the Cullens. I made sure of it," he explained."Why?""Let\'s just say\xe2\x80\xa6 Mia has some tricks up her sleeve\xe2\x80\xa6 the minute she arrives Forks and we\'ll leave it like that," Charlie smirked."Why do I have a feeling you\'re hiding something from us Charlie?"Charlie chuckled "Trust me Harry," he puts his hand on his shoulder "You\'re going to be in shock the minute you see Mia she\'s not the same person that she was before," he murmured.Harry noticed his best friend\'s sadden look "What do you mean?" he asked.Billy sighed "I think you should tell him Charlie," he murmured."Tell me what?" Harry asked."It\'s Harry\xe2\x80\xa6 Mia\'s husband\xe2\x80\xa6" Charlie began to say with a grim look "I wasn\'t sure if I should tell anyone about Mia\'s life but, you two are my best friends besides Sue and .. I just\xe2\x80\xa6 I\'m still in shock even though it\'s been 3 \xc2\xbd years since he pass away?" he explained."Who did?" Harry asked."Harry\xe2\x80\xa6 he pass away \xe2\x80\xa6 "Harry stared at Charliek then at Billy who also grim look "You\'re kidding," he blurted out."Nope\xe2\x80\xa6 Mia had a hard time losing him\xe2\x80\xa6 he\'s not the only person who past away though?""Who else?""The Weasley\'s\xe2\x80\xa6 Molly\xe2\x80\xa6 Arthur\xe2\x80\xa6 Bill\xe2\x80\xa6 his wife Fleur thier daughters Victorie, Dominique .. then there\'s Percy with his wife Audrey with thier daughters Molly and Lucy then \xe2\x80\xa6 Ginny with her husband Seamus with thier children, Dean and his wife Hannah\xe2\x80\xa6 they\'re all gone\xe2\x80\xa6" Charlie choked in his tears as he felt really sad that he couldn\'t say goodbye to his old friends "They\'re all gone Harry\xe2\x80\xa6" he explained.Harry face fell as he rushed over his best friend "I\'m sorry Charlie I knew how much they meant to you," he began to say "How did they \xe2\x80\xa6 die\xe2\x80\xa6" he murmured."Well\xe2\x80\xa6 Arthur, Molly, Bill, Fleur, Percy and Audrey were with thier children at the Burrow they were getting ready for the Sunday brunch the whole family were going to meet up later at lunch but, something happen.. Ariel didn\'t go into details though,""What do you mean?""They got killed\xe2\x80\xa6 burned alive\xe2\x80\xa6 inside the Burrow \xe2\x80\xa6"Harry paled at this "Are you serious..""Dead serious\xe2\x80\xa6 the kids\xe2\x80\xa6 are all dead\xe2\x80\xa6 the Weasley\'s\xe2\x80\xa6 the only ones who survived was Fred, George and Charlie Weasley they\'re the only ones who survived\xe2\x80\xa6 and as for Ginny she got killed in St. Mungo\'s with Susan, Hannah\xe2\x80\xa6 Harry and Ron were \xe2\x80\xa6 aurors\xe2\x80\xa6 police in Wizard form\xe2\x80\xa6" Charlie sighed tiredly sitting down on the bleachers "It\'s horrible\xe2\x80\xa6 Mia was heartbroken\xe2\x80\xa6 she hasn\'t \xe2\x80\xa6 healed since then\xe2\x80\xa6 and I think \xe2\x80\xa6 moving away to America\xe2\x80\xa6 here of all places\xe2\x80\xa6 I think it will help her heal from everything that\'s been going on," he explained."Wow\xe2\x80\xa6 I\xe2\x80\xa6 I don\'t know what to say\xe2\x80\xa6 the poor kid\xe2\x80\xa6 and they only got married for five years,""Nine years," Billy and Charlie answered."Nine years how?""Harry and Mia eloped in thier 6th year and after the war\xe2\x80\xa6 they waited five years before they got married from healing from the war and then invited us to the wedding when Mia was 21 years old," Charlie explained."Really?""Uh huh?""Wow\xe2\x80\xa6 so uh what was it that you wanted to show us again?""Yeah," Charlie nodded at this then realize something "Oh right, come on let\'s get inside it\'s nearly ready but, I figured you should get a sneak peek," he explained.Harry and Billy followed Charlie inside the auditorium grabbing something from the side of the wall "Check this out guys," he grinned.Charlie however, pressed a few buttons and the whole floor started to move "You might want to stand in the side Harry, so you guys won\'t fall down," he called out."Right," Harry nodded as he helped Billy with his wheelchair as they both moved to the side next to Charlie as the floor revealed a stadium that looks small but, the ceiling was opening the floor that was empty revealed the stadium "Holy shit," he blurted out."I know right," Charlie grinned "This is all Mia guys\xe2\x80\xa6 she made this with her friends,""Friends from England?""Yes Tai is one of them, he\'s Jay\'s friend from Japan they went to the same boarding school together as kids they stayed in touch over the years,""Really you mean the Japanese kid?""Yep that would be him,""Holy shit\xe2\x80\xa6 you mean all those new kids that were with Tai all know Hermione, Ariel and Jay from England,""Yep Mia is pretty famous remember,""I didn\'t realize she was that famous,""Trust me she is and just wait until the first day in school," Charlie grinned."What\'s going to happen in the first day in school,""Let\'s just say \xe2\x80\xa6 all the students 4,550 students are going to be in here with the parents\xe2\x80\xa6 the staff everyone it\'s going to be in here,""In this small auditorium,""Yes,""Bloody hell\xe2\x80\xa6 no wonder Mia wants to extend the school into a bigger space right,""Bigger\xe2\x80\xa6 she wants a huge room for this whole entire thing Billy do you remember in Hogwarts they have a Quidditch field and all that,""Yeah,""It\'s exactly the same size as that only for the students here\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s all American sports not Quidditch but, she is planning on building a magical school in the Black Pearl property though,""In the reservation?""Yes,""How big did you say it was again the property I mean?""About 650,000 square feet and acres it\'s pretty huge from what Jay told me,""Bloody hell,""That\'s what I said,""So this whole entire thing\xe2\x80\xa6 we\'re going to be here for the first day in Forks High huh?""Yep all the parents of the students, the staff everyone will be here\xe2\x80\xa6 Mia even hired her friends to be the new teacher staff so you\'ll be seeing Mia and her friends here and here, they\'ll be everywhere probably in disguise in case reporters were to find out,""Fucking hell\xe2\x80\xa6 this is huge Charlie how big does she want it?""Well the stadium is about 5,550 square feet and acres it\'s pretty huge; it\'s filled with every American Sport known to man,""Really like basketball, softball, volleyball, tennis, soccer, baseball, etc,""Yep,""Holy shit\xe2\x80\xa6.that\'s pretty huge Charlie,""It is,""How long did it took them to build this?""Under a year it was under construction without Sam and the pack and the Cullen\'s knowledge no one knew that Hermione would be the \'big bad boss\' and owns two of the schools like I said she\'s going to leave a huge expression with a huge Bang,""Well I\'ll be damn\xe2\x80\xa6 I hope there\'s popcorn in this shindig,""There\'s all sorts of food that will be served Billy I promise you that,""How do you know?""Mia told me of course,""Of course she did well I\'ll be damn let the games begin,"Charlie laughed out loud causing Billy and Harry to chuckle not far behind as they couldn\'t wait to see Hermione Potter change the world in this small itty bitty town they call home. In the other side of town was the Cullens house as they were chatting among themselves apparently they got a letter notice but, never paid attention to it until now."Esme what is this?" Alice asked curiously best of her looking at the letter."What is?" Esme asked from the kitchen."There\'s a letter from Forks High?""A letter," Esme peeked outside from the kitchen drying her hands with a towel "Let me see that?" she murmured scanning the letter."Oh right\xe2\x80\xa6 I must\'ve forgot about it\'s a notice for the school?""A notice from the school what about?" Jasper asked.Esme continued to scan the letter once more "Apparently they changed the school schedules,""School schedules," Rosalie cried out rushing over to her family "What do you mean?""Well instead of September 5th being the first day they\'re having it in August 22nd that\'s in three weeks," Esme began to say then realize something "Oh dear\xe2\x80\xa6 we\'ll be away by then\xe2\x80\xa6if we miss more than two weeks \xe2\x80\xa6 the seniors who are graduating this year will have to either repeat another year for extra credit or they won\'t be able to graduate and if they refuse on either of those options they\'ll be suspended for three days,""That\'s ridiculous they never changed the school schedules before?" Rosalie cried out in anger "At least not in this town anyway it\'s a small town,""Well not this year\xe2\x80\xa6 there\'s a new boss in town?""A new boss what new boss?""The new boss who owns the schools\xe2\x80\xa6 Forks High and LaPush High; the construction in LaPush High is still extended to another year instead of finishing this year because there\'s more projects that the new boss wants to add into the school?""Like what?""I\'m not ...sure\xe2\x80\xa6 if we have any other questions we have to ask Charlie Swan since he\'s the one in charge of this,""Charlie\xe2\x80\xa6 Bella\'s father,""Yes apparently it\'s his niece being the big boss to both those schools,""And he just let\'s her just like that,""Yes, she was born here but, didn\'t reveal her name or anything\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s rather odd isn\'t it?" Jasper asked looking at the letter "Has Bella ever mention she had relatives if she\'s the niece of Charlie Swan?"Alice frowned "No she hasn\'t mentioned anything and I\'m pretty sure if she did she would\'ve told us wouldn\'t she?""Well apparently the niece of Charlie is in the big leagues\xe2\x80\xa6from what I heard,""Heard what?""I overheard some of the students from school stating that the big boss is only 23 years old and she\'s already the Head Principles for both schools, it\'s a bit odd and strange that we never know about this?" Emmett asked."Yes it is a bit odd\xe2\x80\xa6 " Alice murmured."Alice have you seen anything in your visions?" Rosalie asked."No I haven\'t had any visions lately not newcomers mostly it\'s just about Bella," Alice told her.Rosalie scowled "Besides Bella any other visitors that we should know about since we were never aware that this niece of Charlie is taking over the whole town. She could be trouble," she argued back."Now, now, Rosie let\'s not be hasting I\'m sure Charlie\'s niece is lovely and I hope we can be friends with her," Esme soothering her daughter."It\'s not right it\'s bad enough we have to deal with Bella being part of this family but, now we have to deal with the mysterious \'niece\' of Charlie Swan," Rosalie cried out in anger and walked away in huff."I\'ll go calm her down," Emmett sighed and ran after his wife "Rose hold on," he called after her as they went to hunt.Deep within the woods without the Cullen\'s knowledge they were being watched by Taichi, one of Jay\'s best friends from boarding school and he\'s been keeping watch since then and decided to talk to Jay after putting a silent charm around where he was not wanting to be heard. Ring, ring."Hello?""Hey Jay it\'s me,""Oh hey Tai what\'s up?""You remember when you asked me to watch over the Cullens?""Yes\xe2\x80\xa6 what about them?""Apparently they got the letter\xe2\x80\xa6""Letter what letter?""The one where everyone in town is going to learn about the new schedules in school,""Oh right the one that Mia planned right?""Yes that\'s right,""How is that going by the way,""Pretty well actually your uncle Charlie brought his friends Harry Clearwater and Billy Black your godfather\'s to the school showed them around what they look like?""And\xe2\x80\xa6?""It\'s coming along quite nicely I\'m sure everyone will \xe2\x80\xa6 be very surprised with the changes around here especially that cousin of yours and her no good for nothing boyfriend,"Jay gave a \'hum\' sound "Oh really? And what exactly did the Cullens say about the new changes?""Well Rosalie scowled as usual but, nothing to report really nothing new there,""And Esme does she know about the changes?""She does she just read the letter telling the children apparently they\'re going to be out of town? Where I have no idea\xe2\x80\xa6 but, whatever they\'re going to plan there\'s a 50% chance they miss the first week of school,""That\'s completely fine we don\'t need them to be meddle into this,""True.. but, they\'re suspicious I\'m not sure if they\'re going to be going away in those two weeks as they\'re going to be missing school or not?""Hmm\xe2\x80\xa6 well if they do miss the first week of school they\'ll either have to make up the assignments or they won\'t graduate it\'s in the school policy unless they want to repeat another year in town then I don\'t see the problem,""Yes I assume so but, what about Sam and the pack?""What about them?""Do they know that you, Ariel and Mia being the \'big bosses\' in both those schools,""No not yet\xe2\x80\xa6 but, I have no doubt that Sam and the pack are up for a big surprise," Jay sighed sipping his drink "Oh shoot I better get ready for the carnival we\'re leaving in a few minutes," he explained."Sure, sure what time are you going to be here?""Well if I know my sister Ariel which I do very well I have a feeling she\'s going to be extra frustrated and will have our flights arrive quite early?""How early?""I would say 6:30 in the morning I would say,""Bloody hell is she that impatient to wait 11 hours in the air,""Tai she\'s 7 \xc2\xbd months pregnant carrying triplets of course she is, you know how Mimi was when she was carrying the quints remember,"Tai shivered on that memory "Oh right\xe2\x80\xa6 sorry about that...it\'s been busy from the past few days,""I notice did you managed to finish the auditorium yet?""We did it should be finished by the end of this weekend it\'s nearly finished,""Good, good I\'ll talk to you when I arrive and we\'ll talk about the details later yeah?""Sounds good and I\'ll keep a look out over the Cullens, Robb and Jon are keeping watch over Sam and the pack in the other side of the woods,"Jay grinned "Good I\'ll see you later okay,""Later Jay,"[Forks, Washington-LaPush Reservation]...While Taichi was watching over the Cullens, Robb and Jon Goldstein were watching over Sam and the pack eating their lunch in the top of the trees."How long do we have to watch over them anyway?""You heard Tai we have to watch over over Sam and the pack keep a low profile for anything suspicious,""Like what?""Oh I don\'t know vampires\xe2\x80\xa6""I thought we killed Victoria and her army last year,""We did\xe2\x80\xa6 but, you remember the Volturi arrival afterwards,""I did\xe2\x80\xa6""They\'re still watching over the Cullens\xe2\x80\xa6 since Bella \xe2\x80\xa6 is still human\xe2\x80\xa6 they are still waiting for the wedding invitation\xe2\x80\xa6 for it\xe2\x80\xa6""You mean she\'s willing to be a vampire\xe2\x80\xa6 ""Yes\xe2\x80\xa6""Bloody idiot doesn\'t she care about her family her father especially what he went through,""Apparently not do you remember what Jay told us about Isabella,""Yeah I remember bloody childish tantrums and she\'s not even that pretty,""Tell me about it and I also heard that Mio is single,""She\'s been single for nearly 3 \xc2\xbd years Jon you already know this already,""Yes I know but, she\'s single Robb\xe2\x80\xa6 and I heard she\'s a radiant beauty,"Robb raise his eyebrow at his brother Jon "Please don\'t tell me you\'re still going after her she\'s going to reject flat out John,""How do you know?""Considering she just lost her husband\xe2\x80\xa6 I wouldn\'t go out with another person after all that she\'s been through a lot and I wouldn\'t do that to Newt,""Newt our cousin?""Yes our cousin\xe2\x80\xa6 they used to go out with each other. I would never betray his trust over that,""What do you mean they used to date?""Well they dated for nearly a year before they broke it off?""How come?""Newt refused to say.. and when I asked Mio she also refused to say and stated it wasn\'t either of our business,""Well she\'s a bit harsh isn\'t she?""She\'s always been protective with Newt since we always tend to bully him as kids but, now we\'re all grown up now\xe2\x80\xa6 Newt is more independant he\'s actually own a business now,""Does he? What sort of business?""Carnivals apparently?""Carnivals\xe2\x80\xa6 like the ones that muggles celebrate in each seasons or something,""Something like that yes,""Why would he want to own a business over that?""It is isn\'t for muggles Jon it\'s non magical and magical for everyone,""Oh I see but, isn\'t that against the law?""Nah \xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s legal in certain places but, you may never know,""Right\xe2\x80\xa6 right\xe2\x80\xa6 tell me again why I decided to help you out?""Because we\'re both good friends with Mio and Newt,""Right\xe2\x80\xa6 right\xe2\x80\xa6""Oh look it\'s Sam and the pack they\'re patrolling the north east, and west and south east and west brilliant this is where we split up. I\'ll go with Sam\'s side and you\'ll go with Paul and his side,""Got it and then we talk to Aqua right,""Right,""See you in the other side bro,""Back at ya mate,"Down below the woods you\'ll see Sam and the pack patrolling during lunch; Jacob Black known as Jake hasn\'t been sleeping well...and been having these epic dreams every night \xe2\x80\xa6 always showing the brunette girl but, never reveals her face. He hears laughter\xe2\x80\xa6 his laugh\xe2\x80\xa6 and saw Seth there holding her while he\'s in the other side with children laughing. He wasn\'t sure how to feel about that and not only that- unfortunately his thoughts were cut off by Paul."Jake you okay?"[no answer]..."Jake\xe2\x80\xa6?"[no answer]..."JAKE?!""Huh what?" Jake shook his head noticing Sam and the pack worriedly over him "What?""We\'ve been trying to grab your attention from the past 10 minutes you okay?""Yeah\xe2\x80\xa6I\'m fine just haven\'t been sleeping well," Jake yawned shaking his head "I\'ll be fine I just need coffee..""Coffee? At this hour usually it\'s for breakfast Jake?""Yeah I know but, I really need coffee if we\'re going to patrol tonight,""Wait we\'re patrolling tonight?""Yeah didn\'t Sam tell you?""Oh crap," Leah swore under her breath "I have a job interview I have to get ready for I can\'t patrol with you guys?"Unfortunately Sam heard this from speaking within their thoughts."What do you mean you have a job interview Leah?""I just have a job interview okay\xe2\x80\xa6 apparently Charlie gave me the job,""A job for what?""A job at the hospital?""But, he doesn\'t work at the hospital,""Your right he doesn\'t but, his niece does,""Huh you know his niece too?"Leah gave a weird look "Uh duh of course I do. I\'m talking about Ariel she\'s the Head Nurse in the hospital that I\'m having a job interview at duh,""Wait what?!" Sam stopped in the middle of the forest causing Leah to bump into them and fell down which she scowled "What do you mean Ariel is the Head Nurse in the hospital,"Leah rolled her eyes "Ariel is the Head Nurse meaning she\'s in charge of the hospital why are you acting so weird today," she scowled."I\'m not being weird you\'re being weird," Sam huffed causing Leah to roll her eyes "Besides it\'s not like Ariel is going to come back to Forks right?""Well of course she is she\'s coming tomorrow,""How do you know?""My mom and dad told me this,""Wait how long have you knew?""Just now,""So does that mean you\'re going to the airport too to pick them up with Charlie, my dad and Harry apparently?""Um no I have an early shift at work so I can\'t make it but, I did make plans with Ariel later tomorrow though?""What kind of plans?""Why do you care?""I don\'t \xe2\x80\xa6. I\'m just curious is that such a crime?"Leah gave a blank look towards her ex-fiancee and mumbled under her breath "Just wait till Mia comes home and she\'s going to murder you," she huffed causing Sam to pale at this."Who\'s Mia?" Paul asked."Our childhood friend, she\'s also Bella\'s older cousin?""Oh great another cousin of Swan,""Her last name isn\'t Swan it\'s Granger well actually it\'s Potter since she\'s married and all,""Who is?""I just told you Mia,""Mia I don\'t remember you telling us this?""That\'s because you never asked me,"In the other side of the world-London, England there\'s a different world-Wizarding World community in England where you\'ll see Diagon Alley you\'ll see two people Draco Malfoy and Blaise Zabini heading inside to Diagon Alley while Hermione Potter, Fred, Weasley, George Weasley, his wife Ariel Weasley\' nee Granger, Luna Malfoy \'nee Lovegood and Neville Longbottom-Zabini \'nee Longbottom heading to the Number 12 Grimmauld Place to rest for a bit while they greeted with Andromeda Tonks, her sister Narcissa and Lucius Malfoy who were chatting among themselves about something."We\'re home!" Hermione called out."In here dear we\'re in the living room," Andromeda answered."Hey," Hermione greeted everyone with a hug "Where is everyone?""Remus and Tonks wanted to double check if we\'re missing anything which is doubtful since it\'s completely empty?" Narcissa sighed sipping her tea "How was the \xe2\x80\xa6 thing that you did?"Hermione sighed "It was\xe2\x80\xa6 difficult at first but, it has to be done\xe2\x80\xa6 I rather feel more at ease if they were living near us which is why I wanted to transfer them in my hometown," she explained."And we get that I would\'ve felt the same way," Lucius slowly nod at this "So\xe2\x80\xa6 Draco tells us that we\'re going to be living a muggle town called Forks..?" he explained."Well\xe2\x80\xa6 only if you want to live with us? I don\'t want to force you into it?""Not at all I think \xe2\x80\xa6 moving away from England away from the reporters would be a fresh start for all of us and I also heard that the property that we\'re going to live in is huge are you planning to build anything around the area?""We are the first of the list is-the Quidditch field," Hermione looking at her list causing Andromeda, Narcissa and Lucius lips to twitch in amusement "And then we\'re going to build new houses around the area, music and dance studio, then there\'s a library can\'t leave out the library of course then there\'s the mall both magical and non magic folk then we\'re also thinking of making a sports center where we can add more muggle sports for the children to learn then there\'s the orphanage for the children," she explained."The orphanage?" Lucius asked all confuse."Mhmm did you know the orphanage in both muggle and wizards/witch don\'t have a lot of food to eat, a place to sleep, etc\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s horrible," Hermione tutted at this remembering where she went to the orphanage with Harry during her honeymoon in the Asian Region "Which is why I\'m building a brand new place for all the children to have their own room, with their things set so they don\'t have to share, enough food, water etc. I want them to feel as if they\'re at home at least that\'s what I\'m planning anyway," she explained."Hermione that sounds wonderful what brought you to think of helping the less fortunate," Narcissa explained."I have a confession to make I\'ve been sponsoring for all the children in the world who don\'t have a home it\'s one of the reasons why Harry and I like to help a lot,""Really?""Mhmm and I\'m not planning on stopping now. It just breaks my heart that those kids don\'t have a lot then we do,"Lucius soften his eyes holding her hand "And we\'ll love to help just tell us what to do,"Hermione beamed "I would love that very much thank Mr. Malfoy,""Ah, ah, ah what did we tell you?""Narcissa and Lucius?""Yes that after all we\'re family Hermione,""Of course,""So what else do we need to do before we leave?""Well I\'m done with packing so not much except pack the furniture in here and the kitchen,""Really that\'s it?""Uh huh,""Then what?""Then we have some fun at the carnival?""In Muggle, London,""Actually I learned it\'s both non-magic and magic for both worlds inside muggle London,""How do you figure that?""My ex boyfriend owns the place so it\'s perfectly safe,""Ex\xe2\x80\xa6 boyfriend?""Mhmm\xe2\x80\xa6""Who is this ex boyfriend of yours?""You know the arthur of: Fantastic Beast and Where to Find them?""Yes, I know that book it\'s one of Draco\'s favorite as a child what about it?""I know the author of the book?""You know Newt Scamander who wrote the book,""Yes, I do,""How?""His grandson?""Grandson?""Uh huh\xe2\x80\xa6""Who\'s his grandson?""Rolf\'s brother Newton Alekander Artus Scamander III being named after his grandfather,""Really and you dated him?""For a bit yes,""For how long?""About a year before \xe2\x80\xa6 Harry and I decided to be a couple,""Huh\xe2\x80\xa6 you little minx\xe2\x80\xa6 does he ever knew about your past relationships,""Of course we\'re good friends and it also helped that I get VIP passes for every carnival fair seasons including the theme parks so we can go whenever we want without going waiting in line for the rides brilliant isn\'t it," Hermione beamed showing VIP passes causing Andromeda, Narcissa and Lucius to gawk at the girl "I\'m just his favorite girl and being his best friend,""Wow\xe2\x80\xa6 you always seem to be tone of surprise you know that,""I know," Hermione giggled as she skipped along heading upstairs leaving them to gawk at the girl and looked a bit amuse until Tonks and her husband Remus walked in seeing Hermione who seemed to be in a good mood "Oh hey papa Remus, hey mama Tonks good day isn\'t it," she explained."It is\xe2\x80\xa6 what got you in a good mood?" Tonks asked."I got us VIP tickets to the carnival today," Hermione beamed passing the VIP passes to both of them along with Lucius, Narcissa and Andromeda to gawk at the girl "I\'m going to grab the kids so we can get ready for the carnival toodles" she explained."Did she just say toodles," Remus murmured."Yes, yes she did \xe2\x80\xa6 well I\'ll be damn\xe2\x80\xa6" Andromeda chuckled at this "I always knew I liked that girl she\'s just full of surprises," she explained."Yes, yes she is," Narcissa chuckled leaning her head against Lucius shoulder who held her close "I think going back to Forks will do good for her don\'t you think Lucius?" she explained."Yes I think it would good for not only her but, for all of us luv," Lucius explained kissing his wife forehead.However, for Hermione she went from being happy to sad heading to the play room to play with the kids who were playing a game, who looked up to see their mum and greeted her with hugs and kisses."Momma!?" James, Seth, Lily, Evie, Henry, Rose, Daisy, Amelia & Hugo ran to their mum who smiled at her babies "You\'re back!""I\'m back what are you guys doing?""We\'re playing a game," James told her."Oh yeah what kind of game?""Hide and seek, Hugo isn\'t a good hider,""That\'s because you keep finding me James,""Which proves my theory that you\'re bad at hiding,"Hugo huffed which Hermione sighed "Oh Hugo bear what am I going to do with you?" she began to say looking at the watch which showed it was 11:30 a.m. "Are you guys ready for the carnival?" she explained."Yeah! We\'re excited momma?""Good grab your things so we can get going huh?""Okay," All the kids gathered their things packing everything which was now empty except their toys not leaving anything behind until Luna went to join them."Hey Mione Draco and Blaise are back. I also pack our lunches and everything,""Brilliant thank you Lulu I was just about to do that,""Your welcome," Luna beamed gathering her sons "Scorp, boys did you have fun today?""Yeah we had fun mama but, we\'re going to be so much fun at the carnival today,""Oh yes we\'re absolutely loads of fun today," Luna explained as they headed to the living room where everyone was gathered "Are you guys ready to go,""Yes we\'re ready to go," Tonks told her."Did you bring your luggages?""Yeah it\'s right here why?""Gather them into a circle and I\'ll put it in my beaded bag so that way it would be less of an hassle when we go to the airport,""Sounds good to me," Draco nodded at this passing their luggages into a circle while Hermione waved her wand and all the luggages with their things are all inside Hermione\'s beaded bag since Number 12 Grimmauld Place is now empty and owned by the Ministry "Brilliant the carnival awaits," he explained as they headed to the carnival."Hold on how are we going there if it\'s in Muggle London,"Hermione grinned "Don\'t worry we\'re taking my car I know how to get there,""Brilliant""Let me call Kreacher real quick-" Hermione began to say scanning around as the manor was once a home, the headquarters of the Order is now empty "Kreacher!" she called over her house elf.A soft \'pop\' appeared revealing Kreacher in his new uniform bowing "Yes mistress you called for me,""Yes, is the Black Pearl Manor in Forks, Washington in the small reservation in La Push ready for us to arrive yet?""Yes, it\'s all clean we even added the frames of each of our former masters-Master James Potter, Mistress Lily Potter, Master Sirius and Regulus Black portraits too we just have to add the furniture and set everything up and should be ready by the you arrive mistress,""Really and how are they liking it the new atmosphere?""They love it so far it reminds them of England\xe2\x80\xa6 that Master Sirius even looked proud of how the manor is now clean since it\'s been awhile since he last stayed there,""Good we should be arriving within a few hours after the carnival and be sure to take short breaks once you\'re set everything else would you and did you talk to Aqua about the \xe2\x80\xa6 burials I told her to talk to you about it?""Yes she told me that the burials should be set within an hour they\'re almost done,""Good, good\xe2\x80\xa6 and did you add the powerful wards there too,""I did we all did,""Good\xe2\x80\xa6 by the time we arrive in a few hours I\'m going to set the password once I get there so no one will trespass over it,""Of course mistress we\'ll see you in a few hours,""Thank you Kreacher that would be all,""Of course mistress see you in a few hours," Kreacher murmured as he bowed and left with a soft \'pop\'"Everything okay?" Neville asked.Hermione gave a small smile "Everything\'s perfect," she began to say as everyone headed inside her KIA SUV as it has undetectable extension charm inside her car to hold many people inside which is brilliant work in her case while Hermione sat in the driver\'s seat since she\'s driving with Luna next to her "You guys set back there?" she asked."Yeah we\'re okay,""It\'s not uncomfortable for you Andie?""Not at all darling it\'s rather rooming actually,""What about you Lucius, Narcissa you guys okay back there?""Yes we\'re both fine, it actually comfortable,""That\'s good what about-""Bloody Salazar we\'re fine, just relax Mya and keep driving, eyes on the road," Draco scolded her playfully.Hermione grinned "Brilliant and I am keeping my eyes on the road I just wanted to be sure" she began to say driving ahead once it turned green and headed to the carnival once everyone was in their seats and made sure to put the seat belts on her kids in their car seats "It shouldn\'t be long it\'s just about half an hour drive from the carnival,""Brilliant do you mind putting on music?""Sure," Hermione turned on the radio as Demi Lovato "Give My Heart a Break" song came on causing her to mouth the lyrics "This is my jam\xe2\x80\xa6" turning up the volume lip syncing the lyrics not noticing her friends were gawking at her as she had an amazing voice singing to the music "Whoo that was a good song,..." she sighed happily then noticed her friends gaping at her "What?""Nothing,"Hermione stared at her friends weirdly and shrugged turning to the next corner where you\'ll see a sign \'Carnival next exit\' "Oh look guys we\'re here,""Really? That was quick,""Yeah it\'s not that far""We could\'ve walked,""We could\xe2\x80\xa6 but, I rather drive since we\'re going to the airport once we\'re done with the carnival,""Are we going to pretend that you were bloody amazing just then?""What are you talking about Blaise?""You were amazing up there Mia since when do you sing?""I always been singing I just\xe2\x80\xa6 don\'t show off is it,""You should definitely put that in motion of that plan of yours Mya?""You think?""Hell ya you should are you kidding, no one can even expect it not even Isabella,""Oh don\'t get me started with her Jay,""You really should nugget,""You think?""Absolutely and the carnival is a short walk but, drive there is much easier,""Oh makes sense speaking of did you manage to get the port keys for tonight,""Not yet but, I will when I see Kingsley he\'s going to meet us there with his family,""Is he?""Mhmm I figured since it\'s our last day we should also spend the day with Kingsley who\'s also like a grandfather to my kids,"Remus, Tonks, Lucius, Narcissa and Andromeda nodded in agreement "I bet he\'s excited huh,""Last time I checked he is he even brought his kids so I figured the kids would have an extra friends to hang out with,""That sounds like fun,"By the time Hermione found a parking lot that\'s when she announced "Guys look," she pointed at the scene ahead of them as they stare at the carnival in awe "So \xe2\x80\xa6we\'re here welcome to the carnival" she explained; she made sure that everyone wore muggle clothes since there\'s some who will be muggles in this carnival."This is the carnival," Draco asked looking around the place."It is," Hermione nodded at this as everyone got out while Remus helped James, Seth, Lily, Evie, Henry, Rose, Daisy, Amelia and Hugo out of the carseats along with the rest of the kids "So \xe2\x80\xa6 what do you guys think?""It looks fun are you sure it\'s both magical and non-magical Mia?""Positive come on Kingsley is probably inside,"By the time everyone gathered their kids inside their strollers they headed inside where they saw Kingsley with his three kids-Noah, Alex and Dylan (all boys) surprisingly who are adopted from the orphanage."Kingsley over here!" Hermione called them over.Kingsley beamed gathering his sons "Come on kids your godmother is here with the rest of the family,""Auntie Minnie is here," Noah perked up."Mhmm she invited us and wanted to spend the day with us before she leaves Noah,"Noah face fell "Awe\xe2\x80\xa6 where is she going papa?""She\'s going to America\xe2\x80\xa6 son\xe2\x80\xa6""Is she coming back?""Maybe one day since she\'s going to live there but, she did say we can visit her wherever we like?"Noah felt better as he always been close to his godmother "That\'s good\xe2\x80\xa6 I don\'t want her to leave me," he whimpered."She\'s not going anywhere kiddo I promise you that," Kingsley assured his sons as they finally saw Hermione and her family "Hello Hermione, everyone thank you for inviting us," he explained."No harm done Kings," Hermione waved it off with a smile as she looked at her godson\'s "Hello Noah, Alex , Dylan how are you liking the carnival so far?" she explained."Hi auntie Minnie and this carnival is really fun and they have this candy like a cloud," Alex was in awe eating his cotton candy "See look,""Cotton candy mind if I take a piece," Hermione asked gently.Alex nodded giving her a piece "Here you go aunt Minnie," he beamed at this."Thank you darling well where do you guys want to go first?""Let\'s go to the Ferris wheel first I always wanted to try that," Alex beamed at this "Can we auntie Minnie?"Hermione chuckled "Of course darling after you," she offered her hand.~*~End of Chapter Seventeen~*~So I\'m always close to Hermione and her family arrival soon once they\'re done with the carnival it will be going back and forth-In Forks it\'s still Wednesday evening while it\'s Thursday afternoon in England so it will be going back and forth between them.

Teddy pleaded looking at his mum.Tonks chuckled "Of course luv go on we\'ll be here," she told him."Awesome," Teddy gleefully cried out as he dragged Hermione his godmother to the water ride while Jay, Ariel, Fred, Draco, and the others followed suit."Maybe after this we an get something to eat since I\'m starving," Luna offered."Sounds like a plan Lulu,""Oh look it\'s Newt," Jay asked."What?" Hermione began to say turning to see her ex-boyfriend Newt who grinned as he gave a wave "Newt," she greeted her friend."Hey Minnie you guys made it I\'m glad I wasn\'t sure if you were going to come or not," Newt asked."Are you kidding I wouldn\'t miss this for anything besides\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s the only time I get to see you\xe2\x80\xa6 since I\'m leaving tonight,""Tonight\xe2\x80\xa6 where are you going?"Hermione sighed turning to Jay, Ariel and the others who got the picture "Guys I\'ll meet you guys at the Ferris Wheel in a bit okay I have to talk to Newt about something,""Alright nugget don\'t take long huh?" Jay nodded at this as he gave a hand shake to Newt "It was nice seeing you again man," he explained."You too Jay," Newt murmured watching Jay and the others heading out then turned to Hermione "What\'s wrong?" he asked.Hermione sighed "My family and I are moving\xe2\x80\xa6" she murmured."Moving...moving where?""To America\xe2\x80\xa6 a small town called Forks do you remember when I used to tell you all sorts of stories on when I was a child,"Newt chuckled " I did you looked happy whenever you talk about your hometown as a child your eyes would light up because of it and-" he began to say realizing something "Where\'s Harry and the others?""How long have you been in England Newt?" Hermione asked."I\'ve been gone for nearly 2 years and just got back from Japan about a month ago why?" Newt asked.Hermione gave a sad smile "Harry\xe2\x80\xa6 he uh pass away\xe2\x80\xa6 about 3 \xc2\xbd years ago during the auror mission," she murmured causing Newt to pale."You\'re kidding\xe2\x80\xa6 Oh Minnie I am sorry \xe2\x80\xa6 " Newt murmurs."Thanks\xe2\x80\xa6so you didn\'t know?""No I had no idea\xe2\x80\xa6I\'ve been traveling all over the Asian Region I really had no idea\xe2\x80\xa6 I\'m so sorry for your loss...""I would\'ve thought\xe2\x80\xa6 Jax would\'ve told you\xe2\x80\xa6"Newt gave a sad sighed "Nah.. I haven\'t \xe2\x80\xa6 talked to Jax\xe2\x80\xa6 in a long while\xe2\x80\xa6 he\'s actually away in Greece right now so we haven\'t had a lot of time to spend some time together?" he explained."Greece for what?" Hermione asked."He and Seth got an owl from their mothers\xe2\x80\xa6 apparently they\'re sick\xe2\x80\xa6""Oh no\xe2\x80\xa6 that\'s horrible are they alright?""I haven\'t heard from him in awhile so it\'s a little worrisome really,""Oh Merlin\xe2\x80\xa6 " Hermione bit her bottom lip nervously "So you\'re here by yourself then?""Oh no I\'m with Theseus my brother and my uncle Theseus it\'s a bit weird calling my brother Theseus so I call him Theo for short?""So it won\'t be confusing right,""Exactly. Do you still sing Minnie?""I still sing just \xe2\x80\xa6 haven\'t sung in a while why?""Well there\'s a talent show that you should try out?""Sing in front of these people no thank you,""Why not you have an amazing voice and I\'m not just saying that because you\'re my ex but, we\'re best friends right?""Of course,""So\xe2\x80\xa6 why don\'t you sing in front of the crowd. It would ease you up a bit you look a little stress than usual,""The press following my every move does suck the energy out of me Newt but, I suppose I could try\xe2\x80\xa6"Newt grinned "What song do you want to sing?""Whatever floats your boat Newt?""Hmm\xe2\x80\xa6" Newt began to say rubbing his chin deep in thought much to Hermione\'s amusement "I\'m sure I\'ll figure something out you should get going your family are waiting for you by the Ferris Wheel," he explained."Oh yes," Hermione nodded at this giving Newt a kiss on the cheek "It was a nice seeing you Newt be sure to keep in touch would you," she explained."Of course Minnie see you you around babez,""Bye,""Goodbye,"Zander\'s P.O.V."Hey dad how long is the line in the Ferris Wheel?" I asked."Not very long oh look there goes your auntie Minnie?" Dad told him.Everyone looked to the left side seeing Hermione Potter rushing over to us with a smile as she was out of breath."You okay auntie Minnie? I didn\'t think you\'d make it?" Teddy asked."Oh I\'m fine Teddy bear and I\'m sorry for taking so long after this ride we\'ll go to that water ride that you wanted to go alright darling," auntie Hermione explained."Okay auntie Minnie," Teddy beamed at this as he looked excited "Hey Zayne look there\'s a roller coaster ride," he explained."Wow that\'s awesome I can\'t wait to try every rides," I blurted out."Well not everything the kids can\'t ride with us Zayne," Dad pointed out."Awe does that mean we can\'t go?" I asked."No you kids can but, we have to take turns to watch over the young ones that\'s all," Dad pointed out."Oh okay cool," CJ murmured."Logan you\'ve been awfully quiet what\'s wrong?" Dad asked.Logan gave a brave smile "Nothing dad just thinking?" he murmured.Dad raise his eyebrow "About what?""Nothing too serious \xe2\x80\xa6" Logan murmured."Are you sure?""Uh huh I\'m fine,""Well alright\xe2\x80\xa6 " Dad began to say pausing for a moment looking at Sophia, Arianna and Hanna my sisters "And why are you girls quiet you usually be chatting by now? What\'s up?" he asked."Nothing daddy," Sophia beamed "I was just thinking if I can ride that one," she explained pointing at the high jumper ride.My aunt Hermione raise her eyebrow "That looks a little dangerous don\'t you think?" she asked."It\'s not that dangerous if you haven\'t tried it Mia?" Draco asked.Hermione sighed "Yes I suppose your right," she murmured.Nobody\'s P.O.V."Still afraid of heights are you?" Blaise teased her."No I\'m not afraid\xe2\x80\xa6 I got over my fear over heights a long time ago?""Since when?""Since \xe2\x80\xa6 5th year,""Before or after we lost Sirius,""Before\xe2\x80\xa6""Who taught you?""Newt,""You mean the bloke that you were talking too? He taught you how to fly a broom?""Something like that yes,""How long have you been together with this Newt fellow?""Almost a year\xe2\x80\xa6 we dated after my 3rd year and we broke up after the Yule ball?""How come?""We\xe2\x80\xa6 just decided to be friends,""Really?""Mhmm he\'s actually the one who gave us the VIP tickets to this place did you know that?""No I didn\'t know that auntie Minnie that\'s so cool so you guys are still friends?""Yes we\'re best friends, he\'s my childhood friend actually down in England,""Really how?""Well we met at this Anime convention we have a lot in common and after awhile you\'d realize that some things are better off as being friends you know,""That\'s nice I\'m glad you guys are still friends auntie Minnie,""Me too darling me too. Oh look we\'re next come on,""How many miss?""Nine,""For all of you?""No just me and my children I mean we\'re a big family after all but, I don\'t want to leave them behind,""Of course after you miss,""Thank you very much come on darlings let\'s go inside," Hermione beamed holding her children\'s hands as they went inside being the perfect little angels in public "Jay you guys go after us since it\'s a big group of us alright," she explained."Of course nugget we\'re right behind you," Jay chuckled showing the VIP tickets to the guy "My group is nine people and here\'s our tickets," he explained."Mr. Granger and Mr. Weasley right?""Yes,""Welcome to the carnival sir and I hope your kids have fun,""Thank you very much. Ariel we\'ll be going ahead alright,""Of course Jay we\'ll be right behind you since it\'s a huge group of us I think all of us made a reservation for this ride,""What\'s your name miss?""Ariel Weasley but, it\'s under my sister\'s name Hermione Potter," Ariel explained.The man, Henry bugged out as he learned their names "Her-Hermione Potter wife of Harry Potter," he blurted out."Yes\xe2\x80\xa6 and do you mind keep your voice down I don\'t want anyone especially the reporters to find us here," Ariel scolded him."Sorry miss after you Mrs. Weasley," Henry murmured."Thank you... " Ariel murmured grabbing her children Percy, Emery, Arthur and her husband George with Fred and his kids Barry and Ana as they\'re together."Blaise and I will take the end Fred,""Right-O Drake," Fred saluted as he went inside after his twin brother George who helped Ariel inside as the kids rushed inside first."After you luv," Draco being the gentleman self which left Luna smiled as she went inside "Mother, father, auntie Andie you guys are coming with us?" he explained."Of course son but, will it fit?" Lucius asked."Of course Mr. Malfoy it has an extended undetectable charm in each ride so it could hold as many people and stuff inside," Henry asked with a nod."Really?" Narcissa asked."Yes Mrs. Malfoy will that be all of you then being the last of the group," Henry asked."My daughter, son in law Remus and my grandson Teddy will be joining us as well," Andromeda began to say turning to Kingsley and his sons "And we have five more people is that alright if they join us in here," she explained."Of course miss," Henry bowed at this as Remus, with his wife Tonks as he helped her inside and Teddy next to Scorpius, Lysander and Lorren sitting down then there\'s Kingsley with his sons sitting across from them watching the ride of the Ferris Wheel spinning in slow motion since it\'s reserved for the Potter\'s family clan"This is really nice," Narcissa asked."It really is Mya said that this is the only ride that can let women who are pregnant since it\'s not a fast ride it\'s a slow one and we can watch the sights in the top to see the whole city of England," Remus explained."Really that\'s actually brilliant and the muggles thought of this?" Lucius asked."From what Mya said yes," Tonks nodded at this sipping her drink "It\'s rather nice up here actually\xe2\x80\xa6 I miss being on the broom since I used to love being in the air as a child do you remember mum?" she explained."Oh yes it does look fun I haven\'t been on these things as a child, it\'s brings good memories," Kingsley chuckled."You really haven\'t been here in a long time huh papa?" Dylan asked."Yes, you can say I over grew up once you get older but, it\'s rather fun I miss going to these type of things beats being in the office all day that\'s for sure," Kingsley murmured."Here, here," Tonks announced lifting her smoothie cup as they clicked their glasses together "So what else should we do?""I think we should ride all of the rides here for the kids to enjoy," Remus offered."I agree," Lucius replied nodding in agreement."I think we should also try that ride over there\xe2\x80\xa6 I think it\'s called\xe2\x80\xa6 Sky Rocket \xe2\x80\xa6 for the kids\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s looks rather fun for their age especially since I used to love flying all the time as a kid," Tonks explained."Oh yes that was rather terrifying for me but, your father knew you\'re a pro for the Quidditch team," Andromeda chuckled over the memories "Speaking of names have you and Remus thought of who you\'re going to name the Quadruplets yet?" she explained.Remus and Tonks looked at each other then he gave a nod "We did,""Well what is it?""I\'m going to tell you what I told Mya last Sunday,""And what\'s that?""You have to wait until the baby shower mum just like everyone else,"Andromeda scowled causing Narcissa and Lucius a bit amuse "But, I\'m your mother surely I can get one tiny little hint,""Nope not even one mum sorry.""Nymphadora why can\'t I know?""Mum please I told you not to call me that and I think you\'re going to love the names I guarantee that,""How do you know,""I just do,"While Hermione and her family were having the time of their lives at the carnival, the other side of England was a small town-Forks; you would think it\'s just a muggle town but, it\'s not really; there\'s magic filled in the air-the Cullens being vampires while Sam and the pack being shapeshifters would be enemies-as tension filled in the air thanks to Bella\'s rash decisions but, we\'re getting ahead of ourselves here. Sam and the pack were patrolling so Jake was a bit impatient for Hermione\'s arrival at the moment."Hey Sam, hey guys sorry I\'m late," Jake answered."It\'s fine don\'t worry about it," Leah assured him causing Jake and the pack to look at her oddly which she noticed "What?""Nothing\xe2\x80\xa6"Leah rolled her eyes "Whatever, let\'s just get over with since some of us have work the next morning and kept changing the fricking patrol schedules again!?" she snapped and huffed patrolling the left side.Sam sighed tiredly "Seth you and Jake go with Leah in the left side, Paul, you, Embry and Quil go in the right side while I\'ll go with Jared in the south and north,""What about us?" Brady asked."Yeah,""You and Collin\xe2\x80\xa6 will go with Paul and the others okay,""Awe man again?""Don\'t start with me Paul don\'t even start with me,"Paul grumbled under his breath "Yeah, yeah, yeah come on pups let\'s get this over with,""We\'re not pups,""Oh yes you are, I\'m older wiser and did this longer than you guys have so therefore I\'m more experience that you pups got it,""Fine\xe2\x80\xa6""Come on Paul let\'s just get over with,"In the other side of the woods-Jake, Leah and Seth were patrolling checking the perimeter until they were alone where Leah decided to speak up."Hey Leah\xe2\x80\xa6wait up,""Hurry up!"Jacob and Seth sighed tiredly as they followed Leah to the left side of the woods "Did you see anything?""Nope everything is clear in this side\xe2\x80\xa6 let\'s check this part of the woods,""Yeah sure\xe2\x80\xa6""Hey Leah?""Yeah,""You said that Ariel is coming right?""Yeah I did,""Did she say what time they\'ll be arriving here soon since Mia is coming home too,""She is?""Yeah didn\'t you know that?""No... ""I could\'ve sworn I told you this already,""No I wasn\'t in the afternoon shift remember I had to help out my mom out at the hospital,""Oh yeah ...my dad told me that Mia is coming home well actually Charlie did but, that\'s besides the point,""Are you serious she\'s really coming home?""Yes,"Seth grinned "That\'s awesome I can\'t wait to see her,""And here\'s the best part,""What?""I\'m going to pick her up tomorrow at the airport while you guys go to school,""Awe man...can\'t I go too?""No you can\'t,""Why not,""You have school Seth you can\'t miss anymore school or else you can\'t graduate,""Aww man\xe2\x80\xa6 how come Jake gets to go,""I don\'t know\xe2\x80\xa6 why are you going anyway?""My dad said he needs my help with stuff after the airport so yeah,""Dang that\'s not fair\xe2\x80\xa6 I want to see Mia,"Leah sighed at this "I\'m sure you\'ll see her soon Seth I also heard that Jay is also coming home too,""Really even Jay too?""Mhmm he has kids,""Who does?""Jay?""Even Ariel?""Yep,""How many?""Well \xe2\x80\xa6 Jay has eight kids,""EIGHT KIDS,""Yes\xe2\x80\xa6""Jeez\xe2\x80\xa6 what about Ariel?""Well so far she has three kids but, she\'s expecting triplets so that\'s six kids altogether,""SIX KIDS?!""Yes?""Is she married?""Who?""Ariel?""Of course she is she\'s happily married to George Weasley he\'s a redhead and he\'s a twin,""A twin\xe2\x80\xa6?""Mhmm he has a twin brother Fred, don\'t you remember in Mia\'s wedding we met the Weasley\'s family and everyone else at the wedding the one who\'s always getting in trouble being pranksters and all that,""Yeah I think so,""That\'s Fred and George Weasley the twins,""Oh yeah\xe2\x80\xa6 I remember them now they\'re so cool they actually invented spy gear I still have it in my room,""What about Jay is he married?""Uh yeah we met her before?""We did\xe2\x80\xa6?""Yes\xe2\x80\xa6 her name is Mal\xe2\x80\xa6 I assume she\'s the mother of the eight children,""Oh right\xe2\x80\xa6 I-I think I remember her is she the one that had purple hair?""Yes that would be her,""Huh\xe2\x80\xa6who else is coming?""Well\xe2\x80\xa6I heard Mia is coming which I just told you guys,""You did\xe2\x80\xa6""Ariel and Jay are coming with their kids are coming too\xe2\x80\xa6""Of course,""And then there\'s friends too maybe it\'s the ones from the wedding that we met?""Oh yeah they\'re pretty cool and did you know that the spy gear that they gave me actually works,""You do since when do you spy on people,""I don\'t usually\xe2\x80\xa6 I just got curious that time...it was wayyyy before we learned the legends are true\xe2\x80\xa6""Really\xe2\x80\xa6""Yeah it really works,""Like what?""Oh you know \xe2\x80\xa6 I hear things\xe2\x80\xa6""Hear things\xe2\x80\xa6 we can hear things now since we\'re a wolf remember?""Yeah I know but, this was before we became a wolf remember?""Oh yeah\xe2\x80\xa6 well what did you hear?""Well...you know how we\'re supposed to be in school in September 5th in our new school year in Forks High?""Ugh don\'t remind me ... but, what about it though?""Apparently I overheard dad talking to Billy and Charlie who told them that it doesn\'t start in September but, in August,""August? For what?""Not sure but, I heard Charlie knows the new boss in Forks High apparently she owns the school?""What do you mean owning the school?""Like it\'s her property it\'s under her name Lee?""Really? She owns both schools which ones?""Forks High and LaPush that\'s why there\'s so many construction it\'s because of the new boss and get this Charlie knows her personally?""Who is it?""Someone name Anastasia Potter? Do you think Harry has a relative that we don\'t know about?""Well\xe2\x80\xa6 I remember that Harry told me he only has one cousin name Dudley but, they stopped contacting each other in his \xe2\x80\xa6 5th year\xe2\x80\xa6 or something like that.. He\'s the only Potter in his family\xe2\x80\xa6 and Dudley\'s mum is from his mum\'s side; his only relatives and they don\'t get along with each other \xe2\x80\xa6 so I don\'t think he has other relatives than that,""Then who\'s Anastasia Potter then?""I have no idea\xe2\x80\xa6 how does Charlie know her?""Apparently it\'s his niece,""Niece?!\'"Yeah,""But, but, that\'s impossible the only nieces and nephews are Jay, Ariel and Hermione there\'s no Anastasia,""Well that\'s what I heard,""You must\'ve heard wrong we all know that Hermione, Ariel, and Jay are the only cousins that Bella has since Charlie\'s family side are \xe2\x80\xa6 dead\xe2\x80\xa6 ""What if it was from Charlie\'s dad\'s side,""It can\'t be Seth since both sides of Charlie\'s parents are all dead,""Oh\xe2\x80\xa6 then who the heck is Anastasia Potter then?""I have no idea...maybe\xe2\x80\xa6 Ariel might know\xe2\x80\xa6 she knows a lot of people?""You think so?""Of course she\'s knows all sorts of people come on let\'s check this part of the woods before we meet up with Sam and the others""Okay,"[England, London-Carnival] \xe2\x80\xa6..Hermione and her family were having so much fun that they haven\'t got a chance to eat after having so much fun; she suggested they get something to eat since everyone was starving."Hey guys are you hungry?" Hermione asked."Starving actually is there anywhere we can eat Mia?" Luna asked.Hermione looked around seeing the food booths as a grin showed upon her lips "How do you guys feel about McDonalds?""McDonalds what\'s that?""It\'s a fast foot restaurant but, since we\'re inside the carnival I assume they\'re hosting a food booth here it\'s not expensive,""But, we don\'t have any muggle money though?""Oh don\'t worry we don\'t need any muggle money for this we have to use tickets?""Tickets what tickets?""These tickets that I have right here," Hermione began to say noticing Draco, Luna, Neville, Blaise, Theo, Pansy, Ariel, George, Fred, Charlie, Lucius, Narcissa, and Andromeda with Tonks and Remus, Kingsley with the children who followed suit gawked at her "What?" she asked."Where did you get those tickets from?""Oh I bought them in advance so we have enough tickets for each ride each brilliant isn\'t it while I grab our food why don\'t you guys find us a table so we can eat okay,""Sounds good you want a booth or regular?""Booth, it\'s much comfortable that way,""You can count on me I\'ll find us a table come on everyone follow me," Jay announced causing everyone to nod at this while Logan, CJ, Zander, Newt and Nelson went to follow Hermione by helping her with the food since it\'s a huge group of them."Auntie Minnie what is that?""These are the tickets we\'re paying for the food?""Not muggle money auntie Minnie?""Not in this luv \xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s more\xe2\x80\xa6 advance that way,""Oooh muggles are very fancy huh auntie Minnie,""Oh yes, it\'s \xe2\x80\xa6 rather the different atmosphere you can say\xe2\x80\xa6""So how much is the ticket for us?""Oh don\'t even worry about it I got this,""Are you sure\xe2\x80\xa6""Yes you guys aren\'t familiar to muggle carnivals so I got this,""Do you need any help to grab the food auntie Minnie?""Probably would since it\'s a lot of people in our group,""I\'ll come help to auntie Minnie,""Thank you Newt, thank you Nelly that\'s very sweet of you?""I\'ll help too,""Thank you Logan,""Us too?""Anyone else?""Meeeeee?"Hermione sighed at this "You\'re so lucky I needed help to carry all the food since it\'s a huge group of us and we\'re going to be leaving soon for another 5 \xc2\xbd hours from now so we have a lot of time before we get ready and head to the airport,""What time is it now?""4:30 p.m. evening time,""Really?""Yeah,""How long have we been in the carnival?""Since 12:45 in the afternoon why do you ask?""Curious. How long are we going to be here for auntie Minnie?"Hermione sighed at this "Not for another 5 \xc2\xbd hours since your auntie Ariel, auntie Luna, auntie Pansy and mama Tonks are all pregnant they\'d want to leave early since they\'re carrying for more than one person in there and well \xe2\x80\xa6 since our flight isn\'t till 3 in the morning we\'re going to stay at one of my friend\'s studio apartment to rest that\'s near the airport so not very long luv,""Oh okay where\'s the studio apartment auntie Minnie?""It\'s about an hour drive from here but, don\'t worry we\'re going to leave soon,""What time are we going to leave auntie Minnie?""Maybe around near 9ish and then we\'ll clean up at the studio apartment,""Oh okay sounds good since I\'m beginning to get tired but, it was a fun day huh auntie Minnie,""Yes, yes, it was,"One of the co-workers in McDonalds "Hello welcome to McDonalds what can I do for you ma\'am,""Yes, I would like to order\xe2\x80\xa6 5 orders of Big Mac with bacon, 5 orders of Quarter Pounder with Cheese and Bacon, 5 orders of Quarter Pounder with Cheese, 5 orders for Bacon Smokehouse Burger, 5 orders of Double Bacon Smokehouse Burger, 5 orders of Big Mac, 5 Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese & 5 orders of Triple Cheeseburger all combos and can you make sure all of those combos are plain please,"The lady nodded writing the order up "Of course ma\'am anything else you want to add in that order?""I would also like 40 pieces of chicken nuggets actually make that 50 chicken nuggets with 54 large drinks and extra large fries 54 of them in that order please,""Anything else ma\'am?""That would be all thank you,""So 5 orders of Big Mac with bacon, 5 orders of Quarter Pounder with Cheese and Bacon, 5 orders of Quarter Pounder with Cheese, 5 orders for Bacon Smokehouse Burger, 5 orders of Double Bacon Smokehouse Burger, 5 orders of Big Mac, 5 Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese & 5 orders of Triple Cheeseburger all combos all plain and 40 pieces of chicken nuggets actually make that 50 chicken nuggets with 54 large drinks and 54 large fries in that order?""Yes, that\'s correct,""That would be \xe2\x80\xa6 24 tickets altogether ma\'am,""Here you go,"The lady beamed with a nod "Thank you ma\'am and here\'s your drinks you can pick any drink by the soda fountain over there,""Thank you very much,""Of course ma\'am and can I get your name m\'ame?""Hermione\xe2\x80\xa6 Hermione Potter,""Perfect, your orders should be called in 20 minutes is that alright?""That\'s completely fine thank you,""Of course have a nice day Mrs. Potter,""Thank you very much," Hermione beamed as she grabbed the cups "Come on Logan, Zayne, CJ, Newt, Nelly, let\'s go grab the drinks for everyone huh?""Okay," Logan and the boys beamed at this as they followed their aunt and godmother to the drinks."Auntie Minnie how can I tell which is which for everyone?""Well\xe2\x80\xa6 since they\'re not familiar with muggle drinks why don\'t we mix it a bit and they can pick their own since I ordered 54 drinks for us?""How many of us are there\xe2\x80\xa6?""There\'s 51 of us since we\'re a big family and everything,""Wow that\'s a lot auntie Minnie,""Yes, yes it is,""What kind of drinks do they have?""All sorts of drinks come on I\'ll show you?"While Hermione and her family were gathering a table, waiting for their food and getting their drinks, the other side of Europe was America-where you\'ll see a small town Forks, Washington was the police station where Harry Clearwater and Billy Black were accompany Charlie for lunch as they were chatting among themselves about the new changes around town and in the schools."So you\'re telling me that Mia did all this?" Harry whispered.Charlie nodded at this "Yeah it\'s all her idea along with Jay and Ariel who suggested some ideas of their own as well," he explained."Really?" Billy asked."Yep, it\'s all them,""But, why use a different name?""She wanted to use a different identity away from people meddling into her business you know how Forks is,"Billy and Harry nodded at this but, then just when either of them were about to answer they suddenly stiffened which Charlie noticed; realizing it must\'ve been the Cullens since they\'re not exactly in good terms well sort of."Hello Charlie, Billy\xe2\x80\xa6 Harry\xe2\x80\xa6" Alice greeted Charlie."Oh hello Alice I didn\'t know you\'re back? I thought you left" Charlie asked."Left? Oh right we haven\'t left yet we\'re not leaving until Monday," Alice explained.Charlie gave a slow nod at this "Of course that\'s understandable," he murmured."What about you?" Alice asked."What about me?""Are you \xe2\x80\xa6 going in vacation,""Not this time I have so many things I have to prepare,""Prepare\xe2\x80\xa6 prepare what?"Charlie noticed his two best friends stiffen at this while he grew uncomfortable feeling the tension in the air "Well\xe2\x80\xa6 my nieces and nephew with their families are \xe2\x80\xa6 going to live here\xe2\x80\xa6 in Forks\xe2\x80\xa6 so I\'m just \xe2\x80\xa6 ya know\xe2\x80\xa6 preparing their arrival that\'s all," he explained."You have nieces and nephews?""Yes\xe2\x80\xa6""I didn\'t know you have nieces and nephews where they\'re from\xe2\x80\xa6"Charlie looked rather uncomfortable "London\xe2\x80\xa6 they\'re from London?""Really\xe2\x80\xa6?""Yes,""So this would Bella\'s cousins?"Charlie slowly nod at this "Yes\xe2\x80\xa6 that would be correct?"Alice noticed Charlie a little uncomfortable from this conversation "So \xe2\x80\xa6 how old are they?""Who?""Bella\'s cousins?""Ah\xe2\x80\xa6 umm Jay would be \xe2\x80\xa6 30 years old\xe2\x80\xa6 Ariel\xe2\x80\xa6 she\'s 27 \xe2\x80\xa6 and little Mya\xe2\x80\xa6 would \xe2\x80\xa6 25 years old\xe2\x80\xa6""Mya?""Yes\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s her nickname.. ""What\'s her name?""Hermione\xe2\x80\xa6 ""Does she have another sister?""Another sister? Who?"Alice gave an innocent shrug "Anastasia Potter? Does that ring any bells?""Hmm? Who?""Anastasia Potter it says so in the letter?"Charlie blinked his eyes owlish as realization dawned to him since that\'s Hermione\'s secret identity since no one in town knows it\'s Hermione "Oh right\xe2\x80\xa6 yes Anastasia\xe2\x80\xa6 she\'s also coming as well\xe2\x80\xa6 she\'s uh Hermione\'s twin sister,""Hermione has a twin sister?

Billy coughed covering his mouth"You were saying?" he asked."Ah\xe2\x80\xa6 yes\xe2\x80\xa6 well Bella and Hermione never get along very well even as children...I guess you can say\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s complicated I suppose,""How come and what about Anastasia does she get along with Bella,""No absolutely not,""Why not?""They just never got along\xe2\x80\xa6 I think it\'s because Bella is always been jealous of her\xe2\x80\xa6""Jealous of who?""Hermione she\'s always been smart for her own her age and she gets along with everyone never had a problem with anyone around her\xe2\x80\xa6 and I think \xe2\x80\xa6 Bella always been jealous on how close I am with Hermione, Anastasia \xe2\x80\xa6 Ariel\xe2\x80\xa6 and Jay \xe2\x80\xa6 since Bells always lived with her mom her whole life before she moved in with me,""I see\xe2\x80\xa6 ""Mhmm\xe2\x80\xa6""So your nieces and nephew are coming to Forks?""Yes,""When?""Next week," Harry answered."Next week?""Yes\xe2\x80\xa6 why are you asking me this Alice no offense\xe2\x80\xa6 ""None taken I\'m just\xe2\x80\xa6 curious is all you never really talk about your side of the family before?""Probably because I don\'t talk about my family side since \xe2\x80\xa6 they\'re all \xe2\x80\xa6 dead...from the war\xe2\x80\xa6"Alice furrowed her eyebrows noticing Charlie\'s stiff tone "War\xe2\x80\xa6?""Yes\xe2\x80\xa6 they got killed\xe2\x80\xa6 I was pretty young \xe2\x80\xa6 when I lost my entire family\xe2\x80\xa6""Oh..

Are you sure?" Hermione asked."Yes, it\'s almost the boys bed time and before I forget here\'s the port keys you requested," Kingsley told her."Thank you Kingsley I really appreciate it," Hermione murmured putting the port keys inside her beaded bag for safe keeping."Of course, of course it was fun we should do this again sometime," Kingsley waved it off holding one of his sons Dylan who was soundly asleep "I haven\'t had this so much fun in a long time," he explained."It really was," Narcissa replied as she bid goodbye to Kingsley with a hug with Lucius who patted him on the back."We should get going too since we\'re going to see you in a few days," Lucius offered."Awe do you have to go grandpa?"

I\'m so glad I caught you," he explained."Oh what\'s wrong Newt?" Hermione asked."Nothing\'s wrong Minnie I just thought I give you this before you leave I figured you might need it?" Newt winked at this.Hermione had a curious look looking inside the bag and see a litter of puppies who were sleeping "Oh my gosh where did you get them?" she asked."I had a friend who owe me a favor I figured the kids would like it," Newt replied."Thank you so much Newt I love it," Hermione replied hugging her ex boyfriend, who\'s now her best friend."Of course Minnie be sure to keep in touch huh," Newt told her."I\'ll be sure to do that," Hermione beamed at this grabbing her notebook writing her new address and phone number "This is my new address and phone number if you\'re ever in America be sure to come visit in Forks huh?" she explained."Forks\xe2\x80\xa6?"

All he knew was that whenever he goes to bed he would see the dream in short versions of the mysterious girl; it didn\'t show her face but, all he knew was that she had honey nut caramel brunette curls and always sits on his lap well more like straddling his lap whenever he thinks about her\xe2\x80\xa6 whoever she was\xe2\x80\xa6 it always intense and vivid very vivid...and wasn\'t sure what to make of it to be honest.Jacob\'s P.O.V."Hey Sam, guys sorry I\'m late,""What took so you so long?"Jake sighed "Dad needed my help with some stuff and I was hoping I can leave early during patrol?""How come?""I\'m going with my dad tomorrow to the airport remember?""The airport for what?""Mia\xe2\x80\xa6 she\'s coming home\xe2\x80\xa6 I\'m going with my dad to pick her up along with Charlie,""You do know if you guys pick her up it won\'t have any room for you guys to be in the car right?""Oh don\'t worry about that," Leah sighed causing Sam and the pack to nearly jump since she just arrived from her work "Ariel said they bought a car here so it would be two cars that they\'ll come together with?""Where did you come from?""I been here from the past ten minutes,""And why didn\'t you say anything?"Leah shrugged "I didn\'t had anything to say and besides\xe2\x80\xa6 they\'re going to take one car they\'re taking two cars because of how many people who\'s accompanying them,""Two cars how many people are coming I thought it was only Mia, Jay and Ariel?""You forgot the kids and their families Jake,""Oh right\xe2\x80\xa6 the kids I forgot they have kids,""YOU FORGOT?!""Well excuse me for having other things in my mind Seth,""Sorry\xe2\x80\xa6"Jake sighed tiredly "No I\'m sorry I\'m just a little\xe2\x80\xa6 cranky\xe2\x80\xa6""Obviously\xe2\x80\xa6""So can I Sam?"Sam grew quiet noticing how tired Jake looked "Yeah you could leave early in patrol\xe2\x80\xa6 but, what time are you going to pick them at the airport?""Around noon so I\'ll be absent tomorrow at school,""Even school too?""Yeah dad said he needed help and I want to have a good sleep before I leave tomorrow so\xe2\x80\xa6 can I?"Sam was about to argue but, noticed Leah\'s icy cold look that left him to sigh "Yeah\xe2\x80\xa6 I guess you can leave early from patrol,""Really?""Yeah since I\'m excited to see Hellcat it\'s been so long since I last saw her,""True\xe2\x80\xa6 but, why the sudden change of mind?""More \xe2\x80\xa6 like change of heart\xe2\x80\xa6 but, I rather not get into it\xe2\x80\xa6""Uh okay...so which side should we go?""Well since our last patrol from the afternoon was from the east side we\'ll check the west side and split up in three groups,""Sure sounds fine,""Which ones are we going to go with who?""Well\xe2\x80\xa6 Jared you, Jake, Seth and Leah will go to the north west,""Didn\'t we went to the north west in our last patrol in the afternoon,""Oh right\xe2\x80\xa6 uhh I guess you guys can go to the south east?""We went there this morning Sam,"Sam sighed tired pinching his nose "Okay\xe2\x80\xa6 okay\xe2\x80\xa6 umm\xe2\x80\xa6 how about you guys go from the cliffs which is \xe2\x80\xa6 south west did you guys went there?" he began to say causing Jared, Leah, Jake and Seth to shake their heads at this "Great you guys check there, then Paul you and I will check in the north west since we haven\'t went patrolled that side then Quil, you Embry take Collin and Brady with you in the west and east side okay" he explained."Okay," the pack agreed to this and split up."Uhhh Sam?""Yeah?""Aren\'t you forgetting something?""Forgetting something?""You said I can leave early during patrol right?""Yeah?""So what time are we going to be done?""Hm\xe2\x80\xa6 since it\'s 10:40 we\'ll stop between 2-3 in the morning so you can leave maybe around 1:30 in the morning and by then I\'ll let you sleep for tomorrow,""Cool thanks Sam,""Sure,"While Sam and the pack were patrolling later that night, neither of them noticed that they were being watched by Robb and Jon Goldstein who were sipping tea minding their own business."Robb?""Yes Jon?""How long do we have to do this again?""Until Mia and her family comes back home?""And when are they coming back again?""Tomorrow afternoon,""Oh that\'s great\xe2\x80\xa6 ""I thought you\'d be happy to see Hermione?""I am \xe2\x80\xa6 I\'m just tired that\'s all,""Well we have been patrolling since they became a pack Jon,""Yeah\xe2\x80\xa6 I know but, that doesn\'t mean I have to like it,""True\xe2\x80\xa6 but, at least we got something good out of it?""Like what?""Well Mia is coming home\xe2\x80\xa6 there\'s going to be huge changes before the Cullens and Isabella come back in September. Well mostly Isabella and so called boyfriend Edmund?""I thought his name is Edward not Edmund?""Same thing,""Right\xe2\x80\xa6tea?""Sure why the hell not," Rob sipped some tea taking a deep sigh "What kind of tea is this?""Peppermint tea?""Really?""Mhmm?""Taste good,""I know which is why is my favorite,""Is this from England?""No it\'s from the new store that recently opened in town?""What new store?""Walmart?""Isn\'t Walmart all over the world though?""It usually is but, they just opened a Walmart here remember thanks to Chief Swan?""Oh yeah\xe2\x80\xa6""Yep.""So\xe2\x80\xa6 which side you want to check?""This time I\'ll keep watch on Jake and his side while you check with Sam and his group,""Right-O see you in the other side,""Back at ya,"In the other side of the world-London, England Hermione and her family finally managed to check out the stuff they needed before they leave and headed to the studio apartment to get ready since they have 2 \xc2\xbd hours left to head to the airport. Some of them decided to take a nap before they get ready while Hermione double check with the stuff hoping not to miss anything like important documents and what not.However, Hermione\'s children decided to wake up from their long sleep since they had a long day today that their mother rushed over them."Hey sleepy heads did you have a nice sleep?" Hermione murmured."Morning momma?" James murmured."Morning Jamie Jam are you excited to meet your uncle grandpa today?" Hermione murmured.James tilting his head with a sleepy yawn "Yeah I\'m excited,""That\'s good Jamie Jam he\'s going to love you guys I can just tell?""How?""Well he\'s my uncle of course he has to love you Jamie Jam since you\'re his grandchild"James giggled "And I love him too even though I don\'t remember him much," he murmured."And I\'m sure he would love you even more," Hermione kissing his forehead "Come on let\'s get you kids ready since we have to get ready for the airport," she explained."I love you momma," James murmured nuzzling his mum."And I love you Jamie Jam," Hermione told him holding him close."Momma\xe2\x80\xa6" Henry murmured causing Hermione to rush over to her youngest son."I\'m here Henry boo I\'m here," Hermione murmured kissing his forehead that was until they both turned to see Seth, Lily, Evie, Rosie, Daisy, Amelia, and Hugo woke up not far behind from James and Henry; she had to sigh and carry them; it was hard at first but, she got the hang of it. Hermione chuckled knowing her kids heading downstairs to the kitchen; the children being in their pajamas and decided to make breakfast only to see Charlie, Tonks and Remus up early preparing breakfast. Charlie who smiled greeted his little sister but, blood."Morning little one," Charlie greeted his sister and ruffled the kids well mostly the boys while Lily, Evie, Rosie, Daisy and Amelia were still tired nuzzling their mum\'s neck "They seem tired,""Morning Charlie," Hermione greeted him with a hug well tried too anyway "And yes, apparently, they woke up after I went to get something out of my room with James," she murmured.Charlie nodded "Let me carry them while you get yourself some breakfast huh?" he offered.Hermione looked relieved "Thank you," she murmured as she passed the quints to their godfather Charlie who whimpered not wanting to be away from their mum "Shhh it\'s okay luvs it\'s just your uncle Charlie your godfather. He\'ll be watching you guys for a bit while I get ready alright,""Momma no go," Henry cried out not wanting to be away from their mother."I\'m not going anywhere little one this won\'t take long," Hermione murmured "I\'m just going to grab your breakfast see," pouring some cereal on their bowls with milk.Henry whimpered not wanting to let his mum go being the youngest; he\'s definitely a momma\'s boy just like his brothers which Hermione didn\'t seem to mind; she loves her quints and the kids more than anything and wouldn\'t change either of them for the world. Hermione rushed over to grab five bottles of milk bottles checking the temperature not to hot or cold; it was just right and checked each bottle; they\'re all cool off and gave it to the quints as they happily drank their bottles.Charlie smiled "I don\'t know how you did it Mia but, you\'re a perfect natural for them I can see why Ron and Susan would pick you as their godmother while I\'ll be their favorite uncle," he explained.Hermione chuckled "Well I suppose I am a natural since I\'m their mother after all," she explained.Charlie nodded "True," he sighed "Did you even sleep at all? You look really tired,""I\'ll be fine," Hermione waved it off looking at the time\xe2\x80\x94it\'s now 11:45 p.m. then turned to Charlie "We should be there within the hour. I\'m going to check on Ariel and the Weasley twins along with Jay and the children since they\'re the last ones to wake up. Our flight doesn\'t leave until 3 in the morning sharp, so we should be meeting the others soon," she explained."Are you sure?" Charlie asked looking worried."I\'m sure you go get ready I\'m just going to double check if we have our documents to leave this place,""Alright, I\'ll go get ready but, what about the kids who will watch them?" Charlie asked."I will since I already took a shower and got ready before you guys woke up," Hermione pointed out."Oh okay I\'ll go shower then," Charlie announced."Thanks Charlie," Hermione began to say looking at the kids seeing Teddy who was the first one to get ready so far "Teddy darling do you mind watching the little ones while I grab the others?" she asked."I don\'t mind auntie Minnie," Teddy beamed."Thanks darling," Hermione replied playfully as she raced to the next room to check on Jay and his kids then Ariel, George, Fred with their children.Ariel stirred up hearing the alarm clock and turned it off stating it was 11:45 late at night but, they had to get ready for the airport since they\'re now at the studio apartment so it was a short walk "Georgie\xe2\x80\x94 "she murmured "We have to wake up,"George groaned "What time is it?""11:47 we have to get up our flight is in 3:00 in the morning,""We have plenty of time though,""Yes but, we have to get there ahead of everyone so that way we won\'t miss our flights,""Alright\xe2\x80\xa6 alright do we have too it\'s so early luv\xe2\x80\xa6"Hermione lips twitched, slowly opening the door peeking thru the door "Big sister are you awake?" she murmured not wanting to wake up her nephew and niece.Ariel yawned "Yeeeeeeah" she yawns tiredly "We\'ll be down in a few minutes I just have to get ready Mia," she explained.Hermione nodded "Okay, do you want me to grab Arthur, Emery and Percy?" she asked."Would you?" Ariel perked up "Since you\'re awake and all, I\'m still a bit jet lag," she murmured."Of course," Hermione nodded at this seeing her godchildren/nephew/niece seeing them stirring as she smiled "Morning little sunshine we should get ready for the airport, don\'t worry you don\'t have to change we can just a jacket over your pajamas since it\'s going to be a long flight," she explained.Percy II stirred up blinking his eyes; Percy is mixture of George and Ariel put together while Emery looks like Ariel except her eyes are blue while Percy\'s is brown then there\'s baby Arthur who\'s a mixture of George when he was a baby with Ariel\'s brown eyes. It\'s a cute mini family."Morning Percy bear did you sleep well, let\'s get you, your sister and brother ready for our next destination hmm?" Hermione murmured picking up her godchildren/nephew/niece. Percy smiled reaching his small arms for his godmother while Emery and Arthur whimpered not wanting to be left out "Don\'t worry baby Emery, Arthur, I didn\'t forget about you guys," she picked up her niece bouncing them; Ariel yawned stretching her arms smiling at the scene."Morning auntie Minnie," Percy murmured nuzzling her neck "Where are we going again?""We\'re going to Forks, Washington that\'s all the way in America," Hermione murmured."Oh\xe2\x80\xa6" Percy grew quiet then reached his small little hands "Mommy," he beamed."Hey baby boy did you sleep well?" Ariel asked as she slowly carried her eldest son then turned to Hermione "Georgie and I are going to get ready under an hour and head to the airport knowing the others are waiting for us," she murmured."Yes, I think that\'s a good plan I\'ll let Luna and Draco go ahead with their group and meet them at the airport since it\'s a short walk downstairs,""Perfect," Ariel told her as she passed Percy to Hermione "Oh don\'t forget to feed Arthur would you,""Of course," Hermione nodded as she steadied Percy, Embry and Arthur on her arms heading downstairs "I\'m going to feed them their bottle Teddy is now ready to go he\'s just waiting James and the kids, Charlie is getting ready and I haven\'t got a chance to wake up Jay though he\'s probably still asleep along with the kids," she explained."I\'ll wake him up along with the kids since we need to get ready quickly," Ariel quickly added."Brilliant and I\'ll gather our stuff into one bag so that way we don\'t have to carry so much in the airport," Hermione pointed out."Good idea," Ariel nodded at this kissing her husband George on the check who sighed lying on the bed for a few minutes then turned to her husband "Georgie I\'m going to take a shower first then you\'ll go afterwards okay luv," she explained.George smiled kissing his wife lovely "Take your time luv I\'ll just take the guest room bathroom since we have to leave pretty soon," he explained. Ariel nodded as George got out of bed grabbing his clothes and went to the guest bathroom while Ariel took their bathroom in their bedroom. A few minutes Fred, George and Ariel were ready to go; Jay got up a few minutes after Hermione and ate his breakfast chatting away with Charlie who are now ready to head to the airport while feeding the young ones."Come on Henry time to eat huh?" Jay tiredly says with a yawn."No, no, no, no," Henry refused shaking his head at this "No hungry,""I got this Jay," Charlie offered.Jay blinked his eyes with a tired yawn "You sure?" he asked."Yeah go take a shower I got this," Charlie pointed out "Henry doesn\'t usually eat this kind of stuff Mya gives him his waffles with blueberries since he hates strawberries,""Of course he does," Jay yawned ruffling Henry\'s hair "Since when do you hate strawberries Henry huh? Huh, huh huh," causing Henry to giggle "You\'re lucky your uncle Charlie is here for you kiddo," after checking on his kids then his godchildren who were still sleepy then stared at his best friend Charlie with a nod "Alright I\'ll go get ready then y since we\'re meeting my uncle Charlie pretty soon he wants to take us to dinner in our first night," he explained."Trust me by the time you get ready the rest of us will be double check with our packing before we head to the airport," Charlie pointed out.Jay yawned at this "Bloody hell don\'t I know it," he shook his head "I\'m going to take a shower first. Logan, Zander, CJ, Sophy take the shower downstairs while I\'ll take the one upstairs then Newt, Nelson, Aria and Hannah go next, so we won\'t long okay," he explained."Okay dad," Logan, Zander CJ & Sophia answered who took a quick shower from their bedrooms as they have their own bedrooms in Number 12 Grimmauld Place despite how it\'s practically empty now it\'s a bit weird; then Newton and Nelson their brothers took a shower next then Arianna and Hannah their adopted sisters who happened to be their cousins then their dad were done under 10 minutes after each other; weird but, okay but, it helps being ahead of schedule."Morning dad," Logan yawned at this drying his hair."Morning son how you\'d sleep?" Jay asked."Okay how about you?" Logan asked.Jay shrugged "I\'ll survive do you mind helping Newt, Nelly, Aria and Hannah with their clothes while CJ and Sophy gather your things in the living room since we\'ll be leaving really soon,""Okay dad," Logan yawned as he grabbed his backpack filled with his stuff, along with CJ\'s, Zander\'s, Sophia\'s, Newts, Nelson, Arianna and Sophia\'s stuff thanks to the undetected extended charm from their auntie Hermione\'s help where they can put more stuff inside as much as they want\xe2\x80\x94Charlie and Fred Weasley were gathering their things making sure not to forget anything then Ariel and George with their children then Hermione who should be done about now with the kids following not far behind in tow."Hey what are you guys talking about?" Hermione asked drying her hair in a French braid on her hair and put her beanie hat with some dark blue jeans, a flower top, Adidas shoes and made sure her locket was locked and secured around her neck not wanting to lose anything that her husband Harry gave her."We were just talking about uncle Charlie who used to be a wizard like us?" Jay asked."Use to be a wizard?" Fred asked, "Who is he again?""Don\'t you remember you guys met him at Mya\'s wedding with Harry a few years ago?""You mean that guy that looked like a police officer is that him?" George asked."Yep that would be uncle Charlie he\'s protective with us ever since we can remember," Jay nodded at this sipping his coffee at this "Just like we\'re protective with him. I told you guys about my uncle Charlie a few times over the years. He\'s the one that lives in Forks where we\'re going to be living now," he explained."Really?" Charlie looked surprised at this "You guys seem close with your uncle huh? What about the others""Yeah, he\'s the best uncle we ever had," Jay chuckled then frowned and scowled feeding Henry, James, Seth, Lily, Daisy, Rose, Amelia, Evie, and Hugo their breakfast which was cereal "But, then there\'s our estrange cousin Isabella we must consider," he scowled and gave an irritated huff which surprised Charlie, Fred and George who blinked thier eyes since they\'re not used to Jay being irritated by anyone "I really can\'t stand her...and then there\'s my godparents uncle Billy, uncle Harry, auntie Sue who\'s my uncle\'s Harry\'s wife they\'re really cool. My aunt Sara died a few years ago which is why you saw my uncle Billy in a wheelchair then there\'s their kids Rebecca and Rachel who are twins then Jacob, then for uncle Harry and auntie Sue they have two kids Leah and Seth Clearwater we\'re pretty close but, as for Isabella not so much," he explained.Charlie was about to ask until Jay went upstairs to check on Remus, Tonks and Andromeda who are still getting ready since they\'re all leaving together."What was that about Mia?" Charlie asked.Hermione sighed "We don\'t get along with our cousin?""How come?""We just never got along she\'s our estrange cousin she\'s about \xe2\x80\xa6 five years younger than me and I would\'ve been the same age as my childhood friend Sam but, I aged 2 years than my original age due to the time turner \xe2\x80\xa6 " Hermione explained.Charlie nodded at this "Ah ... the mysteriously cousin that you, Ariel and Jay can\'t stand huh? Why do you guys hate her so much? Was she invited to the wedding" he explained.Hermione\'s eyes harden for a minute then took a deep breath to calm down "Isabella and I always hated each other\xe2\x80\xa6and no she was not invited to my wedding I won\'t have that selfish inconsiderate no good for nothing bitch in my wedding since she instantly gets really jealous quite easily especially on how close Ariel, Jay and I are with our uncle Charlie because they have an estranged relationship with one another besides why would I invite her since we never get along and I won\'t have her ruin that \xe2\x80\xa6.since Isabella lived with her mother Renee her whole life," she sneered at this which Charlie noticed with his eyebrow raised that his forehead looked shocked by that comment "And because she\'s close with her mother Renee \xe2\x80\xa6 uncle Charlie actually consider me, Ariel and Jay as his children despite how he only has one child with Isabella but, they\'re not close\xe2\x80\xa6I don\'t know if you remember my uncle Charlie but, he gave me away at the wedding when Harry and I got married along with my parents, he\'s a head police chief in Forks," she explained.Charlie, Fred and George did remember meeting their uncle Charlie from the wedding he\'s a sweet guy along with the rest of the lot "Oh yeah I remember him now and he brought your godparents right before \xe2\x80\xa6?" Fred murmured."Yes, that would be them\xe2\x80\xa6 my uncle Billy can\'t walk anymore so he\'s in a wheelchair now and my godparent\'s uncle Harry and auntie Sue would help him out whenever they can with their children all grown up they pretty much keep to themselves," Hermione murmured."Really?" George asked."Yeah my uncle Charlie used to be a wizard back in the day\xe2\x80\xa6 but, he lost his magic in the first war\xe2\x80\xa6 before Harry lost his parents\xe2\x80\xa6" Hermione murmured "My uncle Charlie got married 2x Isabella doesn\'t know about his family before\xe2\x80\xa6 he had four boys\xe2\x80\xa6 Logan, Cameron, Ben and CJ\xe2\x80\x94short for Charlie Jacob\xe2\x80\xa6my auntie Aaliyah was expecting another baby which was a girl she was going to tell my uncle Charlie the news but, that was before they got killed by ... Bellatrix, Barty Crouch Jr and Dolohov. I\'m so glad that I killed them when I did back at the war\xe2\x80\x94well the last two but, thanks to Mrs. Weasley she killed Bellatrix for nearly killed Ginny\xe2\x80\xa6" she murmured.Charlie nodded at this "Yeah thanks to mum I wouldn\'t be surprised if they killed every death eater and I\'m sorry that happen to him that must\'ve been awful," he murmured."It was \xe2\x80\xa6 and thank you\xe2\x80\xa6" Hermione began to say sipping her tea "And I really miss them?" she murmured.Charlie soften his eyes giving Hermione a hug "I miss them too\xe2\x80\xa6 and I bet Harry miss you too," he whispered.Hermione blinked her tears away giving a brave smile "Yeah I miss him every day but, I\'m sure he would\'ve want me to move on\xe2\x80\xa6" she paused at this looking at the clock looking at the time "We should get going now if we don\'t want to miss our flight and I was hoping you can double check everything in case I miss anything before we head out I don\'t want to leave anything out" she explained.Charlie nodded at this "Way ahead of you luv," he grinned "Jay and I will be leave last while you guys head to the airport this shouldn\'t take very long to meet with everyone else at the airport," he explained."Good," Hermione murmured scanning around one more time before they head downstairs to the airport since the studio apartment will disappear once they leave.James, Seth, Henry, Lily and Evie were inside their strollers being pushed by Teddy then there\'s Rosie, Daisy, Amelia and Hugo who were being pushed by Zander then there\'s his siblings-Logan, CJ, Sophia, Newton, Nelson, Hanna and Arianna who followed suit carrying their backpacks full with their stuff. After a few minutes Ariel, George, Charlie, Fred, Jay, and Charlie were now ready to head to the Ministry to get the portkey from Kingsley ready who gave extra port keys that Hermione requested in the last minute."Here you go Hermione have a safe trip," Kingsley murmured "Be sure to let me know you guys made it to Forks safely will you," he quickly added."I will Kingsley," Hermione murmured as she steadied holding her children covering them from the press with the invisible cloak and exit the building without being notice as she went to meet Charlie and the others at the airport waiting for her. Once Hermione apparated to the airport not wanting to be seen from the reporters she saw her friends waiting for her."You guys ready to go?" Hermione asked."Yes, we\'re ready," Luna murmured nodding at this carrying the twins Lorcan and Lysander while Draco carried Scorpius while Blaise and Neville grabbed the twins Leo and Allie II steadying them inside their strollers, Jay with his children\xe2\x80\x94Logan, Zander, CJ, Sophia, Newton, Nelson, Arianna and Hannah then George with his wife Ariel and their two kids Percy II, Emery and Arthur Corey, while being 7 \xc2\xbd months along pregnant with unborn triplets who will be born within 2 \xc2\xbd months Bill II, Ronald \'Ron\' II, and Ginevra Molly Rose \'Ginny or Gin\' II soon then Fred, with Barry and Anya his kids, Charlie, Remus, Tonks with Teddy with their unborn quadruplets, Mrs. Tonks, Narcissa Malfoy with her husband Lucius Malfoy and then Hermione with her family. Everyone has their belongings ready to go and set off to Forks, Washington in Seattle, Washington Airport.They checked in the airport with their children, got their passports, check in their bags, etc and waited till they were boarded in the airplane. It was only 4:20 so they had a lot of time left but, they did board the plane early though, so it wasn\'t so bad; the flight to Seattle, Washington was 11 hours so at least they\'ll have some sleep in the way."Mya how long is your flight for?" Draco asked."Eleven hours usually," Hermione answered."ELEVEN HOURS?!" Draco exclaimed causing Luna to cover her husband\'s mouth not wanting him to be rude.~*~End of Chapter Nineteen~*~Oh my gosh *yawns* you would think I would write a lot but, this took a while and I noticed that some of the chapters are longer than I realize hmm\xe2\x80\xa6 I should fix that when I get a chance anywayyyy Hermione and her family finally at the airport getting ready to take up\xe2\x80\xa6 11 hours to go\xe2\x80\xa6 get ready guys they\'re about to arrive in style. hahaha\nChapter Twenty: Goodbye England, Hello Forks!"Shhh," Luna scolded him "You\'re being rude Draco," she playfully squats him on the shoulder."Sorry," Draco mumbled rubbing his eyes from being so tired."Oh, don\'t be such a baby Draco," Hermione huffed "At least you\'ll have some sleep since we took a nap at the studio apartment remember," she pointed out.Draco sighed tiredly "Yeah I guess your right\xe2\x80\xa6" he murmured "Bloody hell and I thought our flight was that bad\xe2\x80\xa6 Blaise and I will see you guys soon,""I love you Draco and please be careful," Luna murmured kissing her husband."And I love you too and Scorpius, watch over your brothers and your mother with your unborn sister will you," Draco asked his son."Don\'t worry I\'ll watch over mummy and our family," Scorpius puffed his chest causing his parents to chuckle "You can count on me dad," he explained."Good, good I\'ll see you in two weeks maybe early than that we\'ll see how it goes," Draco murmured."Bye luv," Blaise kissed Neville and the kids "Leo, Ali you two be good for papa okay,""We\'ll be good daddy," Alice murmured "I love you daddy,""And I love you too princess Leo watch over your sister huh?" Blaise asked."I will papa," Leo yawned leaning his head over his daddy Neville\'s shoulder "I love you papa,""And I love you don\'t wander off huh," Blaise told him."We won\'t," Leo and Alice both answered."Bye babe be careful both of you," Neville told his husband Blaise and his brother-in-law Draco."Of course, and you guys be careful too,""Always," Hermione smirked then noticed that Theo and Pansy haven\'t arrived yet "Hold on where\'s Pansy and Theo with the girls I thought they were going to see us off?" she explained."Theo gave us an message stating that they\'ll arrive with us within two weeks since Pansy is pretty tired from the long day we had," Draco assured her."Oh okay that\'s fine I\'ll just see you at our Disneyland trip," Hermione beamed."Exactly and she\'s excited over this Disneyland trip that you plan for us Mia," Blaise pointed out."Well I had to do something for my children since it\'s their birthday week," Hermione winked "We\'ll see you guys in two weeks and please be careful," she explained."We will and you guys be careful too," Draco assured her."Always," Hermione told them as they headed to their apparition spot to their next destination as everyone held tight to one another while Blaise and Draco watched their families leave."You do know that Mya is going to kill us if she finds out \xe2\x80\xa6. about\xe2\x80\xa6" Blaise was cut off by his best friend Draco."No, she won\'t\xe2\x80\xa6not if you keep dragging the subject for her to hear" Draco muttered under his breath "You heard Potter\xe2\x80\xa6 considering his creature inheritance whatever he is taking his sweet time to hatch and will you lower your voice we don\'t want anyone to overhear us" he hissed at him.Blaise sighed knowing he\'s right "Sorry but, it\'s true you know I am\xe2\x80\xa6 I still think she\'s going to bloody kill us,""I know she will but, not as much as\xe2\x80\xa6 Luna and Neville being our spouses are also going to kill us for keeping this from them but, I have a feeling Lulu knows \xe2\x80\xa6" Draco muttered under his breath."How can you tell?" Blaise flatly replied."Because of her vision you know she can see the future right and I have no doubt she\'s going to be the first ones to find out then she\'s going to kill me for not telling her sooner..." Draco coolly says causing Blaise to widen his eyes in surprise but, kept quiet "Come on let\'s get this over with \xe2\x80\xa6 hopefully we\'ll know what\'s going on \xe2\x80\xa6with Potter" he explained muttered under his breath."Merlin knows Hermione\'s going to kill us for keeping this big secret from her,""Will you relax we\'ll tell her when the time comes but, for now Potter has to keep a low profile even if it\'s away from his family\xe2\x80\xa6""Yeah I know\xe2\x80\xa6 I just hate keeping secrets from her she\'s not known from being the smartest witch of her age you know,""I know\xe2\x80\xa6 I know\xe2\x80\xa6 you don\'t have to remind me," Draco scowled as they both apparated to a different location.Hermione Potter, Luna Malfoy, Jay Granger, Charlie Weasley, Fred Weasley, George and his wife Ariel Weasley, Remus and his wife Tonks, their son Teddy, Andromeda and their children just arrived at their flights as they were just in time to head inside."Alright guys here\'s our flight\xe2\x80\x94BX98012 London, England to Seattle, Washington that\'s our stop," Hermione announced "James, kids hold hands and keep close to me whatever you do don\'t let go of our hands alright loves," she murmured."Okay mummy," James and the kids muttered following their mother Hermione, their aunt Ariel, aunt Luna, uncle Neville, leading them inside the airplane with Charlie Weasley ending the line with his brother Fred and George Weasley. After a few minutes Hermione and her family were finally inside their seats were First Class if they\'re heading to their new home they might as well ride in style."Mione what class did you book us in?" Neville asked."First class I figured why the hell not," Hermione shrugged at this "It\'s much spacer then I realized,""Muggles are so fancy huh Mione," Luna smiled at this sitting next to her sister."You have no idea," Hermione murmured as the children were sitting in the middle seats while Luna, Hermione and Ariel sat in the right side while George, Fred, Charlie and Jay sat in the left side that had four seats on the other side of their kids then Remus, Tonks, along with Andromeda were sitting between the kids so it wasn\'t so bad."Hello, what can I get you ladies a drink?" one of the flight attendants asked."Yes, can I have a Ginger ale please with two sprites," Hermione answered."Of course, ma \'me," the flight attendant as she poured the drinks for them "Here your drinks ma \'me,""Thank you ever so much," Luna beamed at this as the flight attendant nodded at this "Oh and our children from the first four rows will have orange juice," she answered."And my husband one of the red-headed twins over there George\xe2\x80\x94he\'ll have coke cola, and his brother Fred will have sprite, Charlie will have the same and our brother Jay will have Pepsi," Ariel explained.The flight attendant blinked her eyes looking around the room noticing the people must\'ve be a big family "Of course ma \'me I\'ll get right on it,""Thank you," Hermione answered pausing for a moment "I have a quick question?""Of course, what is your question ma \'me?""Do you guys sell Shirley Temple with extra cherries by any chance?""We do? Do you want me to add that vodka in your drink for you ma \'me?""No thank you just regular Shirley Temple please,""Okay ma \'me may I please have your i.d.""Of course, here you go," Hermione passed her driver\'s license\xe2\x80\x94Hermione Potter who she nodded at this."Thank you Mrs. Potter and I\'ll bring your drink for you would you ladies want one too?" she asked."Yes please, non-alcohol please," Ariel answered."Coming right up,""Thank you,""Of course, ma \'me and I\'ll bring up your breakfast menu momentarily soon,""Take your time,"In the other side of America was \xe2\x80\xa6 Arizona-Bella and Edward were currently staying with Renee, Bella\'s mum and her step dad Phil who took them to lunch until Phil announced that he had to run to practice so Renee accompany her husband while Edward spend his time with his girlfriend/fiancee Bella discussing some things. Since Edward\'s family-Carlisle, Esme, Rosalie, Emmett, Alice and Jasper were getting ready to head to Greece for vacation neither of them knew about the changes around Forks (a/n: I know this is probably random but, I figured I add them into the chapters-well some of them since I don\'t really like their characters very much and I really don\'t like Bella Swan-as for Edward Cullen eh\xe2\x80\xa6 he\'s okay (lol) well that\'s enough of my rambing I\'ll be getting out of your hare and let you read the rest of the chapters)"So Bella how\'s school coming along?" Renee asked her daughter."It\'s been good\xe2\x80\xa6 classes are beginning to get hard but, I get manage," Bella murmured eating her pasta while Edward kept quiet."And you Edward? How\'s your classes going?" Phil asked trying to make conversation."Pretty well," Edward politely replied."So what does your parents do Edward?" Phil asked."My father Carlisle he\'s a doctor, he\'s really good at what he dos and my mother is an architect in town one of the good ones actually," Edward politely explained."Really?" Phil asked raising his eyebrow at the kid."Yes sir,""Hmm\xe2\x80\xa6 that\'s good,""And you?""Baseball player I\'m still getting there,""Phil\'s doing well at what he does. I\'m very proud of him,""Thank honey," Phil smiled at his wife lovely then his cell phone rang recognizing the ring tone looking at the caller i.d. Then frowned "I should get this it might be work excuse me," he murmured rushing outside.However, Phil\'s new wife Renee, her daughter Bella and her boyfriend doesn\'t realize is that he knows what\'s been going on with his step daughter and her boyfriend in Forks since he\'s a wizard. He\'s not exactly happy but, he kept his emotions in control; he even talked to his wife Renee if she wanted to have another baby? At first Renee looked surprised by this but, told him that she on board to have another baby. When they went to the doctors two days ago apparently Renee is eight weeks pregnant since she wasn\'t feeling well it worried him vividly but, was stunned by the news when they found out.The minute they came back home Renee told her daughter Bella over the news since their over the moon over the news expecting another baby but, Phil noticed a change over his step daughter\xe2\x80\xa6 when he saw her reaction apparently she didn\'t look happy but, pretended to be for her mother\'s sake even Edward looked stunned by Bella\'s reaction to and got into another argument over it in Bella\'s old bedroom in low tones and use a silence charm once he found a good spot to talk to his cousin."Hello?""Hey Philip,"Phili sighed at this "Henri\xe2\x80\xa6 what\'s up?""What\'s up what makes you think something\'s up?\'"Usually you don\'t call me unless it was business,"Charlie sighed with a snort "Your right I don\'t but, I need to talk to you about Bella,""Oh\xe2\x80\xa6 and what about Bella?""Are you alone in your office?""I\'m outside with Renee, Bella and Edward we\'re having lunch right now,"Charlie sighed and swore under his breath "Damn it\xe2\x80\xa6 ""Why what\'s wrong?""I was hoping I can talk to you in your office but, your out?""I can head home if you want?""No\xe2\x80\xa6 no\xe2\x80\xa6 then it will get suspicious \xe2\x80\xa6 Edward will try to meddle he can\'t help himself\xe2\x80\xa6 listen when you and Renee picked them up? What was your first reaction towards the kid?""You were right\xe2\x80\xa6 he tried to read my mind but, Henri he can\'t since it\'s protected,""So he only can only hear static then?""Yes, I have a powerful barriers inside my mind you know that,""Good just like I taught you,""Of course you always been my favorite cousin,""And yet you dated my ex wife,""I didn\'t know she was your ex wife Henri,""Yeah I know but, don\'t worry though I\'m already over her\xe2\x80\xa6""Which one?""Don\'t test me kid,""Right\xe2\x80\xa6 sorry\xe2\x80\xa6""It\'s fine but, what did you think of him?""He\'s polite?""Philip?"Phil sighed tiredly leaning against the wall "He\'s \xe2\x80\xa6 nice\xe2\x80\xa6""Philip\xe2\x80\xa6""Okay\xe2\x80\xa6 okay\xe2\x80\xa6 he\'s \xe2\x80\xa6 exactly who you described I kept my distance but, I don\'t think Renee knows,""Of course she doesn\'t know I haven\'t even told her that I\'m a wizard\xe2\x80\xa6 you know before I lost my magic\xe2\x80\xa6 you\'re lucky you still have yours,""I know\xe2\x80\xa6""Hold on did you use a silent charm for us to talk?""Of course I did trust me he won\'t find out anything about our family background I made sure of it,""Good\xe2\x80\xa6""Speaking of \xe2\x80\xa6 uh family background\xe2\x80\xa6 Renee and I have some news\xe2\x80\xa6""Oh\xe2\x80\xa6 what sort of news?""She\'s pregnant\xe2\x80\xa6 ""Renee\'s pregnant?""Yes\xe2\x80\xa6?""Are you sure?""I\'m quite positive considering we saw the \xe2\x80\xa6 ultrasound two days ago Henri at the doctors because she wasn\'t feeling well we\'re both surprised by this notion"Charlie sighed at this "Congratulations?""You\'re not mad?""Nope\xe2\x80\xa6 I told you I\'m over her\xe2\x80\xa6""Are you sure \xe2\x80\xa6 because\xe2\x80\xa6 when you found out \xe2\x80\xa6 we haven\'t talked in over 12 years Henri until you called five years ago when our youngest niece Hermione got into a war with her husband Harry and their best friend Ron right after we both apologize to each other?""Right\xe2\x80\xa6 and we both care about Mia as much as I like to admit,""I know it was wrong\xe2\x80\xa6 but, I couldn\'t help who I fell in love with Henri\xe2\x80\xa6 even if it\'s your ex-wife Renee\xe2\x80\xa6""I know\xe2\x80\xa6 it took me awhile but\xe2\x80\xa6 I was angry...but, after rethinking everything I realize I can\'t\xe2\x80\xa6 stop Renee for leaving but, the thing that really hurt the most is that she could\'ve prevent me and her from getting married in the first place but, then again if we didn\'t get married years ago we probably would\'ve have Bells and I\'m grateful for that don\'t get me wrong it just\xe2\x80\xa6 made me realize that I shouldn\'t linger in the past any longer\xe2\x80\xa6 which is why I decided to adopt a kid or maybe more than one kid?""Adopt more than one kid?""Yes,""How many kids are you thinking to adopt?""Well if the kid has a family like siblings I\'d adopt all of them,""But, you don\'t have any room in the house though?""Oh don\'t worry about the house Phil \xe2\x80\xa6 I got another house not even Bells knows about?""Which one?""Do you remember Sirius Black our old friend\xe2\x80\xa6 the one who helped me and Almaak a few years ago during the first war\xe2\x80\xa6""Of course \xe2\x80\xa6he saved yours and Almaak your life if it wasn\'t for him, his father Orion and his brother Regulus right?""Yes that\'s right if it wasn\'t for them me and Billy wouldn\'t be here alive with new lives of our own.. but, he left the manor to Mia our niece,""Really?""Yes and it\'s a big property,""How big?""It\'s about \xe2\x80\xa6 650,000 six hundred and fifty thousand square feet and acres. Mia\'s already building a few houses around the property as we speak. I even made plans to upgrade on what I wanted for the house to look like for the kids. By the end of this year the house will be done under four months,""Really that quick usually it would take a year to build that long""Yes it usually does but, you know Mia she\'s preparing for the next couple of projects in Forks without anyone finding out that includes Bells and the Cullens they don\'t know about the changes until the first day of school,""First day of school?""Yes they changed the first day in Forks High?""Oh really to when?""August 22nd not September 5th,""That\'s within 3 \xc2\xbd weeks isn\'t it,""It is,""Does Bella know,""Nope she has no idea\xe2\x80\xa6 and guess who\'s the principle in that school now?""Who?""Mia? She\'s using a secret identity by Anastasia Potter to keep up with appearances but, the first day of school she\'s going to take off the mask by then,""Shouldn\'t Bella know about this since it\'s her school,""She should\xe2\x80\xa6 but, I want her to spend her time with her mother\xe2\x80\xa6""Henri what do you know?"Charlie sighed tiredly once again "How much do you know about the Cullens,""Besides the fact they\'re vampires\xe2\x80\xa6 who feed on animal blood\xe2\x80\xa6 they\'re one of the respectful clans in the magical community \xe2\x80\xa6 why?""Anything else?""Edward Cullen, Alice Cullen and Jasper Hale all have powers not much\xe2\x80\xa6 why?""Did Renee tell you what happen when Bella been living with me from the past 3 years,""She didn\'t have too since I already know what happen?""But, did you hear that Bella wants to be a vampire \xe2\x80\xa6 an immortal to be with Edward,""SHE\'S WHAT?!"In the other side of the country; there was one flight\xe2\x80\x94Hermione\'s flight with her family were taking off when the kids strapped their seatbelts until they\'re up in the air."Hello passengers it\'s your captain Martinez speaking we\'re about to take off to Seattle, Washington momentarily if you need anything please let the flight attendants know. Thank you for flying in British Airlines to Seattle, Washington. We should be arriving around\xe2\x80\x949:00 am in the morning as scheduled signing off," the captain answered and that\'s when they took off to the air while the kids looked through the window in awe murmured to Jay, Fred, George, Charlie and Neville."Hey Mione," Luna whispered as she was sitting between Hermione and Ariel."Yes Lulu," Hermione yawned at this."How long will this flight take? Luna asked."About 11 hours," Hermione yawned "So we have a loooong way to go," she yawned again leaning her head against the pillow "Why do you ask?" she asked.Luna gave a smile "Sounds like it\'s going to be a long ride and you should sleep Mione you look you might need it and no reason Mione I was just wondering," she explained.Hermione yawned shaking her head "I can\'t do that the kids\xe2\x80\x94they might need me\xe2\x80\xa6 "she yawned."Trust me they\'ll be fine they have us\xe2\x80\xa6 you need your sleep Mione since we\'ll have your uncle waiting for us at the airport soon,""That\'s true," Hermione murmured "Are you sure you don\'t mind,""I don\'t mind at all it would help me catch up with my reading,""Reading," Hermione yawned "Since when do you like to read," laying her head against her seat.Luna lips twitch "I\'m just reading the latest ones in Quibbler from daddy before I lost the magazine and the company\xe2\x80\xa6it\'s a good thing that Draco bought the magazine in America it\'s quite popular there" she murmured.Hermione yawned "If you say so \xe2\x80\xa6and that\'s brilliant Lulu I can\'t wait to read it..." as she dozed off to sleep."Poor Mione\xe2\x80\xa6 she must\'ve slept late after the party in Wednesday," Luna murmured worriedly over her best friend.Ariel gave a sad smile "She was crying the night we had the party when everyone left""What?" Luna asked looking at Ariel alarmed "Is she alright?"Ariel sighed "Yes she\'s fine but, apparently Fred and George gave her something that belonged to our nana\'s heirlooms\xe2\x80\xa6 Harry must\'ve found it because when she opened the jewelry box it played her wedding song with Harry" she whispered.Luna felt saddened over this biting her bottom lip "Poor Mione that must\'ve been hard," she murmured that\'s when the turned on the takeoff seat belts sign since we\'re up in the air after 20 minutes being in the air "Be right back I\'m going to the loo,"Ariel nodded at this "I\'ll be here,""Mummy, mummy look, look," Percy and Arthur cried out pointed at the clouds."I can see that sweetheart," Ariel murmured."Are we on the air mummy?" Emery asked."Yes, princess we are," Ariel murmured "Don\'t talk so loud sweetie your auntie Hermione is asleep right now,"Emery yawned blinking her eyes "Sorry\xe2\x80\xa6" she whispered turning to her auntie then back at her mum "Mummy does that mean we\'re no longer in England anymore?Ariel yawned "Yes luv, I believe we\'re no longer in England anymore\xe2\x80\xa6 we\'re in the air heading to America to visit your uncle grandpa Charlie he lives in a small town called Forks that\'s in Seattle, Washington well near it anyway since we\'re going to live there darling" she explained."What\'s it like mummy?" Emery asked as she nuzzled next to her mum.Ariel smiled fondly over her little girl "Well, it\'s a small town not much to report really\xe2\x80\xa6 there\'s a beach called \'first beach\' it\'s really beautiful there\xe2\x80\x94you get to see your uncle grandpa with his friends who happened to be mine, your auntie Hermione and uncle Jay\'s godparents," she smiled fondly over her home town looking at her husband George who was chatting over with Fred, Charlie, Neville and Jay as he gave a playfully wink to his wife who poked her tongue at him in return\xe2\x80\x94it\'s kind of their thing "And when you\'re a little older there\'s a wizardly school in Seattle called Salem Academy of Magic hopefully things will work out luv," she explained."Really mummy me, Arthur and Percy can go to another magical school in Washington," Emery perked up at this."We\'ll talk to daddy and see what he says," Ariel murmured."Tell daddy what?" a familiar voice asked causing Ariel and Emery to turn to see George with curiously on his eyes."Daddy," Emery perked up "Mummy said we can go to another magical school that\'s near uncle grandpa isn\'t that great daddy," she explained."Oh really\xe2\x80\xa6?" George asked raising his eyebrow at his wife Ariel who nodded at this "Well if that\'s what you, Arthur and Percy want to go then I don\'t see why not luv,""I would love that daddy I really would," Emery perked up at this."Then your mother and I will consider it when we arrive to Seattle, Washington then," George explained."Yay!" Emery clapped her hands excitedly "Does that mean Barry and Anya along with the rest of our cousins can come too mommy,""Pretty much every one of your cousins really," Ariel murmured."That\'s really cool mummy," Emery says."Yes, yes it is since I used to go to that school when I was a student before I transfer schools to Hogwarts it would be great to see my old friends again," Ariel explained causing Embry to perk up."Hey luv why don\'t you stay with your uncle Fred for a bit while I talk to mummy okay," George offered at this "And you can tell Anya and Barry the great news hmm?" he winked at his daughter."Okay daddy," Emery jumped off her mum\'s lap heading over to her uncle Fred who seemed surprised at this as he helped his goddaughter up and sat on his lap while setting Anya and Barry onto his lap as they watched the window.They left around 2:40 in the morning fifteen minutes early from their flight and left England from the past\xe2\x80\xa6 six hours\xe2\x80\x94it\'s a long way they have five long hours to go since it\'s now\xe2\x80\x946:00 am in the morning in Pacific Time. Ariel muttered under her breath causing the airplane to speed fast instead of arriving around 11:30 in the morning they were 5 hours early\xe2\x80\x947:45 am which neither of them seemed to mind."Hello passengers we just arrived at Seattle, Washington 6 \xc2\xbd hours early then planned\xe2\x80\xa6 I don\'t remember driving this fast\xe2\x80\xa6I must\'ve went through the shortcut without realizing \xe2\x80\xa6oh well\xe2\x80\xa6 it speed things up a bit so we should be arriving within an hour," the plot murmured sounding so confuse causing Ariel to giggle knowing why "Thank you for staying with us in British Airlines and I\'m speaking for myself and the rest of the staff today we hope you enjoy your trip and see each other soon by flying with us next time in your next trip," he explained as everyone started to gather around to sit down since the plane was about to land without half an hour."That\'s a bit odd\xe2\x80\xa6 I thought we were going to arrive around 11:30 not 6:45 in the morning," Jay murmured noticing hi sister Ariel who looked far from innocent "Ariel\xe2\x80\xa6 what did you do?" he asked."Do what?""Ariel\xe2\x80\xa6""I may\'ve speed things our flight a bit?" Ariel murmured.Jay sighed pinching his nose knowing his sister "Ariel you should be careful knowing the muggles would have caught you," he scolded his sister."No one saw me Jay besides I haven\'t been able to move since I\'m carrying for four people here," Ariel gesturing her stomach "Besides we\'re fine\xe2\x80\xa6 everyone would\'ve been cranky either way I just wanted to get this over with since it\'s took us awhile to get home," she explained."Yeah well..I should\'ve known you always been inpatient even when we were kids," Jay pointed out pausing for a moment "You should let uncle Charlie know since we arrive 5 \xc2\xbd hours early since he\'s picking us up with uncle Billy and uncle Harry thanks to you Ariel," he explained."Oops\xe2\x80\xa6" Ariel gave a sheepishly smile causing Jay raise his eyebrow "Okay.. okay I will text him as soon as we arrive to the airport so he won\'t have to pick us up not realizing we\'re already home\xe2\x80\xa6 " she began to say turning to their sister Hermione "Mya\xe2\x80\xa6" she murmured.[no answer]..."Myabee\xe2\x80\xa6 wake up sweetie\xe2\x80\xa6""Hmm\xe2\x80\xa6 what? What is it? Is it the kids?" Hermione murmured."No, no the kids are fine we\'re just about to land very soon,"Hermione blinked her eyes owlish "What do you mean?""I mean we\'re already near Seattle, Washington already,""What that\'s impossible we should be there in 5 \xc2\xbd hours by now,""Yes, yes, I realize that but, \xe2\x80\xa6 we\'re not\xe2\x80\xa6""But, why I thought we were going to arrive around 11:30 in the morning?""We are\xe2\x80\xa6 but, we arrived a bit early then planned?""How early?""About 7:45 in the morning early?"Hermione stared at her dumbly "How in Merlin did we arrive early \xe2\x80\xa6" she began to say noticing Ariel\'s guilty look "Ariel what did you do?" she asked."I may\'ve speed things up a bit," Ariel murmured.Hermione sighed at this "Please tell me you were careful when you did this?""Yes I was careful no one saw me Mia," Ariel began to say as her lips twitched "And I always been impatient Myabee \xe2\x80\xa6 5 \xc2\xbd hours is a very looooooooooooong time I got bored,""You got bored of course you did," Hermione sighed at this as she couldn\'t stop her older sister once she\'s set on something no one can change her mind "Well yes I realize that but, does uncle Charlie know yet since we arrive early?""Not yet I\'m going to let him know when we\'re close to Seattle, Washington,""What time is it though and how far are we?""About an half an hour away and it\'s 7:15 in the morning,"Hermione yawned resting up a bit "Okay, wake me up in 15 minutes I just feel really tired," she murmured."Will do," Ariel nodded in agreement sipping her ginger ale looking around her family as she texted her uncle Charlie since there was Wi-Fi explaining their flight arrived quite early than planned.Ariel\'s P.O.V.We had a long week and finally heading to America since we just left England six hours ago and now we have 5 \xc2\xbd hours left but, I decided to speed things a bit so now we\'re now arriving within half an hour instead arriving in 11:30 in the morning since I got bored and went to text uncle Charlie.\'Good morning uncle Charlie,\'It didn\'t take long for my uncle Charlie to text back.\'Good morning sweetie, you\'re awfully early I thought you\'d still be in the air heading down to Seattle, Washington by now,\'\'Hold on let me call you in a bit so we can talk okay,\'\'Okay\xe2\x80\xa6\'Ariel got up with the help of Luna who helped her "I\'ll be right back Lulu I need the loo,""Okay I\'ll be here,"Once Ariel was by herself she put a silent charm around the bathroom and called her uncle Charlie since it\'s now 7:15 in the morning they should be arriving soon."Hello?""Hey uncle Charlie,""Hey sweetie so what\'s the bad news?""Well\xe2\x80\xa6 apparently we can\'t go home today?""What?! Why?""It\'s raining?""Raining?""In London we had to miss our flight today because of the rain it\'s rather pouring rather hard at the airport?""What you\'re kidding\xe2\x80\xa6""Nope so we have to wait until tomorrow hopefully the weather will be clear by then?""So\xe2\x80\xa6 you\'re not coming\xe2\x80\xa6 you\xe2\x80\xa6 Mia\xe2\x80\xa6 Jay\xe2\x80\xa6 the kids\xe2\x80\xa6 along with your friends\xe2\x80\xa6 you\'re not coming today\xe2\x80\xa6""I\'m afraid not\xe2\x80\xa6"Charlie face fell feeling rather disappointment "Well\xe2\x80\xa6 that\xe2\x80\xa6 really sucks..""Yes\xe2\x80\xa6 yes it does\xe2\x80\xa6""So\xe2\x80\xa6 you\'re not coming so there\'s no point of me picking you guys up\xe2\x80\xa6""Yes I\'m afraid so uncle Charlie\xe2\x80\xa6I\'m sorry\xe2\x80\xa6"Charlie sighed sitting on the couch "No\xe2\x80\xa6 no it\'s completely fine \xe2\x80\xa6 I\'ll think of something,""What do you mean?""Well your godfathers Billy and Harry are accompany me we were going to pick you guys up today and Jake too,""Jake?""Yes he insisted on coming along he wants to see Mia and the rest of you guys so \xe2\x80\xa6 he\'s going to be so sad \xe2\x80\xa6 and disappointed that you guys aren\'t coming today\xe2\x80\xa6"Ariel bit her bottom lip nervously "Oh now I feel bad\xe2\x80\xa6 ""Bad\xe2\x80\xa6""Yes\xe2\x80\xa6 I lied uncle Charlie\xe2\x80\xa6""You lied\xe2\x80\xa6about what?""We are coming today\xe2\x80\xa6 I just wanted to prank you\xe2\x80\xa6""PRANK ME ?!""Yes\xe2\x80\xa6""Why?""I got bored\xe2\x80\xa6""You got bored\xe2\x80\xa6 and thought to prank me by stating that you guys aren\'t coming that wasn\'t funny Ariel,""I know I\'m sorry\xe2\x80\xa6it sounded a lot more sense in my head""So you\'re really coming your not pranking me on this,""Yes we\'re really coming it\'s just\xe2\x80\xa6 our flight changed that part is true?""What do you mean your flight changed?""Well instead of arriving at 11:30 in the morning\xe2\x80\xa6 we\'re arriving within half an hour \xe2\x80\xa6 well 15 minutes from now actually so\xe2\x80\xa6 there\'s no need to pick us up since you have work today don\'t you?""No I don\'t have work today it\'s my day off today because I wanted to pick you guys up and what do you mean you\'re arriving in 15 minutes it\'s barley 7:20 in the morning"""Yes I realize that and you don\'t have to do that uncle Charlie everyone is still tired from the carnival last night?""Carnival and the only reason why we\'re arriving early it\'s because I may\'ve speed things up a bit on our flights?""You \xe2\x80\xa6 speed your flights from arriving instead of 11:30 to 7:20 in the morning what time are you going to arrive?""I would say\xe2\x80\xa6 7:45 in the morning\xe2\x80\xa6.and as for Mia she decided to surprise us at the carnival in our last day yesterday before we head to the airport to kill time so everyone is pretty tired from having fun,""Ariel I hope you were careful with that,""Trust me I got scolded from both Jay and Mia and yes I was very careful no one saw me uncle Charlie,"Charlie sighed "Well that\'s good and \xe2\x80\xa6 if you guys are coming around 7:45 in the morning do you guys still want us to pick you guys up? I don\'t mind at all it\'s a little early but, I don\'t mind at all""Oh no you don\'t have to do that uncle Charlie we\'re still a bit tired and I don\'t want our kids to be really cranky when they meet you?""Are you sure because I don\'t mind?""We\'re sure besides they\'re very cranky and I don\'t want to leave a bad impression we taught our children with better manners than that uncle Charlie,""Ah..of course that\'s understandable and I wouldn\'t want that either so\xe2\x80\xa6 what am I supposed to tell Jake, and your godfathers?""Jake?""Yes he\'s coming with us to pick you guys up I just mentioned that remember?""Oh right umm you can tell him there\'s no need since he has school today doesn\'t he?""Yeah he does but, he really wants to see you guys?""Make up a story to tell uncle Billy I\'m sure he\'ll figure something and we can still see each other in the afternoon it\'s just everyone is still tired ya know,""Yeah I can understand that but, speaking of that prank you were very sneaky and for a minute there I actually believed you,""I know and I\'m really sorry about that\xe2\x80\xa6 I just\xe2\x80\xa6 got bored and mum said that you always fall for that kind of trick,""So I heard and I haven\'t been prank in so long not since I was a kid\xe2\x80\xa6 I grew up way too fast to \xe2\x80\xa6 deal with that kind of stuff\xe2\x80\xa6""I know we all did and ya know\xe2\x80\xa6 since you\'re meeting up with uncle Billy and uncle Harry you should do the same to them?""What do you mean?""Pull a prank it might make change your mood today,""Change my mood?""Yes?""Like what?""Pretend that we\'re not coming and make up a story. Pull that inner kid uncle Charlie I bet he\'s been wanting to come on mum said you were the King of pranks back in school in Hogwarts come on \xe2\x80\xa6 you might as well try it out again since we\'re coming home uncle Charlie,""I haven\'t pulled a prank since I graduated from Hogwarts \xe2\x80\xa6 I may be a little rusty on the jokes,""Oh come uncle Charlie don\'t you want to see their reaction especially Jake\'s I bet he would love that,""You really think so? Wouldn\'t be angry with me for pulling a joke like that,""He probably might but, it\'s in our inner prankster uncle Charlie besides you should live a little\xe2\x80\xa6 how long has it been since you had any fun around town\xe2\x80\xa6 after all being a prankster is one our specialties in our family\xe2\x80\xa6 especially since you\'re the one who taught mum and the rest of your family to be a prankster that was all you uncle Charlie,"Charlie chuckled knowing his niece is right "You know what I think I will thanks kiddo I really needed that laugh,"Of course uncle Charlie but, since we\'re not going to see each other in the airport later why don\'t we meet for a late lunch?""A late lunch?""Yes,""You know what\xe2\x80\xa6 I think that would be awesome and I can pull a few strings stating that I\'ll take your godfathers away for a few hours we can go fishing since you\'re going to be home in a few minutes right,""Yes, so what time do you want to meet up?""How about\xe2\x80\xa6 we meet around 4:00 sharp so that way you guys will be wide awake when we meet up with each other how does that sound and we can meet at the Manor as planned so it shouldn\'t be long since today is my day off today and I\'ll even bring your godfather\'s with me,""Sounds like a plan but, what about Isabella she\'s not going to be here is she?""No, she\'s not in town she\'s with her mother for the summer, I just talked to Renee last night apparently Bella was hoping to stay until her birthday\xe2\x80\xa6 so she\'ll be missing two weeks of school\xe2\x80\xa6 but, I didn\'t tell your aunt that making her think she\'ll miss only a week when in reality she\'ll miss two weeks of school?""How come?""I want Bella\xe2\x80\xa6 to spend her last days of vacation with her mother before she gets back to school since she\'s graduating this year?""But, isn\'t the first day in Forks High in August 22nd instead of September 5th like it always has uncle Charlie,""It is,""Then why not tell her that they changed the first days of school?""Let\'s just say \xe2\x80\xa6 Mia took care of that bit?""Mia?""Mhmm apparently she\'s going to be the head principal and teacher of Bella\'s school? She\'s the one who changed everyone\'s first day in high school in both schools along with the new classes and the classes will start at 7:30 in the morning instead of 8:10 in the morning and it will end at 5:00 instead of 3:15 in the afternoon""Really she changed the whole schedule,""Yeah she did and she also changed the classes instead of only 6 classes it\'s now 8 classes for extra credit when the kids go to college she wants them to be prepared for the real world, didn\'t Mia tell you all this?"No I haven\'t heard that. I must\'ve been so busy packing that we haven\'t got a chance to talk about the whole changes around Forks,""You didn\'t?""No does Jay know?""Yes he knows,""And why am I the last one to know about this?""I figured you would\'ve knew about now since the construction around the school is nearly finish by the time it reaches August 22nd everyone in town will be seeing the grand opening of the new school term and everything?""How do you know that?""Considering I\'m announcing it to the entire town and the auditorium is nearly finished it\'s nearly the same size of the stadium?""Stadium what stadium?""The one that Mia requested to add inside the school?""There\'s a stadium inside Forks High?""Yes and in La Push High but, they won\'t open until next year not the end of this year,""How come?""Mia is also the head principal in La Push since she owns both schools?""She owns both schools?""Yes,""Can she do that?""Considering she bought the school I assume so since she\'s the head principal everyone\'s talking about it but, they don\'t know it\'s actually Hermione as their head principle,""Really?""Yes,""Did she tell you that?""Yeah she told me,""Huh \xe2\x80\xa6 I thought she was going to be the student there?""She was \xe2\x80\xa6 but, then she thought\xe2\x80\xa6 since she already graduated there\'s no point so\xe2\x80\xa6 she thought why not be the head principle and be the teacher of the kids\xe2\x80\xa6 and there you go she\'s been making all sorts of changes around town\xe2\x80\xa6 we even added new fast food restaurants and extended the town a big bigger""Really?""Yes so what do you think?"Ariel sighed "Yeah I\'m down to meet up later uncle Charlie and I\'ll tell Mia, Jay with everyone I bet it would be fun to see everyone again,""It will and I\'ll see you later okay sweetie I should get ready so I can tell your godfather\'s the plan okay,""Okay bye uncle Charlie and let me know what they say?""Will do bye sweetie see you guys soon,""Bye uncle Charlie,"Once I went to the bathroom and went back to my seat since I heard the pilot made another announcement I rushed back to my seat not to fast but, just in time to rest for a bit before we land in Seattle, Washington."Hello passengers it\'s your captain speaking. We\'re just about to arrive to Seattle, Washington momentarily within 10 minutes. Thank you again for staying with us in British Airlines, I\'m speaking for myself and the staff once again we hope you enjoyed your pleasant flight and fly with us soon in your next trip," he explained as we landed in Seattle, Washington.\'Goodbye England, Hello Forks\xe2\x80\x94more like Seattle, Washington same difference really,\' I thought to myself.Everyone gathered their things once their flight went into the front in full stop. It\'s a good thing Hermione got up a while ago."Mya, you ready to go," I announced at this."Yes, I am come on lovely\'s it\'s time for us to leave," Hermione murmured as James, Sirius, Henry, Lily, Evie, Rose, Daisy, Amelia and Hugo were strapped into their strollers not that they need one but, with a huge family of children neither of us wanted to take any chances."Mummy I\'m hungry," James announced."You\'re hungry didn\'t you had anything to eat in the plane Jamie Jam," Hermione murmured.James shook his head at this "No\xe2\x80\xa6 I didn\'t know we can eat on the plan momma?"Hermione blinked her eyes owlish and sighed "Of course you didn\'t luv that\'s probably my fault\xe2\x80\xa6come on guys it\'s this way," she announced. Fred, George, Jay, Luna, Neville with the children along with myself followed her exiting the plane as we went to the chairs to recount everyone."Jay are we missing anyone?" I asked.Jay counted everyone\xe2\x80\x94Logan, Zander, CJ, Sophia, Newton, Nelson, Arianna, Hanna his family, then there\'s Fred with his kids Barry and Anya and Charlie Weasley, George and I with our children\xe2\x80\x94Percy, Emery, Arthur inside their stroller and myself carrying the triplets\xe2\x80\x94being 7 \xc2\xbd months just three more months before my kids are born and I can finally eat whatever I want, then there\'s Luna with her children\xe2\x80\x94Scorpius, Lysander and Lorcan, then there\'s Luna being pregnant with their daughter Pandora \'Penny\' being 7 \xc2\xbd months along as I am, Draco her husband is away in a business trip with Blaise, then there\'s Neville with Leo and Alice, the surrogate mother expecting triplets\xe2\x80\x94two boys and a girl being 5 \xc2\xbd months they\'re still deciding on the names but, I\'m sure they\'ll figure it out then there\'s Remus, Tonks being pregnant 6 \xc2\xbd months with quadruplets, Andromeda, and Teddy. Draco\'s parents Lucius and Narcissa will be visiting us as soon as we arrive and settled around our new home and Theo, Pansy being pregnant 6 \xc2\xbd months carrying triplets all boys with their three daughters are coming to live with us too around September when we\'re close to the baby shower."Yes, we got everyone," Jay announced."Brilliant maybe we can find McDonalds on the way or something?" Hermione offered."Sounds like a plan Mya," Jay smirked at this "Come on kids let\'s find something to eat,""We should also get our stuff before we head to McDonalds Jay," I pointed out.Jay pouted "Damn I was hoping we can do that later but, since McDonalds is outside of this place we might as well get this over with," he explained.We continued ahead following everyone to the baggage area\xe2\x80\x94it didn\'t take very long since Jay, Neville, Fred, George and Charlie grabbed most of our stuff since it\'s much easier it was in the front of everyone else. Tonks, Andromeda Hermione, Luna, and I luggage\'s were mixture of purple, blue and pink with animal print along with the girls\xe2\x80\x94Sophia, Hannah, Aria, Anya, Rose, Daisy, Lily, Evie, Emery and Amelia who had like ours but, in children\'s sizes then Fred, George, Jay, Neville, Remus, Logan, Zander, CJ, Newton, Nelson, James, Seth, Henry, and Hugo who had mixture of blue, red, green, gray and black mixed with children and adult bags. We figured we get the latest fashion in luggage on top of the four carts that Remus, Jay, and Charlie found with Hermione\'s help."Is that it then?" Hermione asked."Yes, that\'s it," Remus announced."Perfect, come on let\'s go I told uncle Charlie to meet us at the manor around 2:00ish since we\'re still a jetlag and he wants to take us out to dinner tonight," I announced.Remus grinned "Sounds good I haven\'t seen Charlie since Mya and Harry\'s wedding since I used to be his classmate back in our school days it would be nice to catch up with him again," he explained."Along with uncle Billy right papa Remus?" Hermione asked.Remus nodded at this "Yes that sound be right\xe2\x80\xa6 Padfoot\'s cousin right who happens to be your godfather?""Yes, that would be correct," Hermione nodded at this "Along with uncle Harry and auntie Sue who\'s friends with uncle Charlie and uncle Billy in the reservation,""Ah yes I think I remember them with their children they were part of the wedding party at your wedding with Harry, weren\'t they?" Tonks asked."Yes, they were since I wanted to add them into the wedding since they\'re practically our family," Hermione murmured nodding at this."I\'m sure they\'re ecstatic to see you Mya," Tonks told her giving her a hand squeeze."I\'m sure they all would since it\'s been nearly 5 years since I saw everyone," Hermione beamed at this after we check in everyone and headed our way. It wasn\'t a long line since we speed things up."Oh, look there\'s a sign," Jay pointed out \'Welcome to Seattle, Washington,\' with a nod "Pluto we\'re not in Kansas anymore," he explained.Hermione and I laughed at this causing everyone to look at us oddly "It\'s a muggle thing you\'ll get used to it," I shrugged at this leaving them to nod at this.That same morning in the other side of the Seattle, Washington\xe2\x80\x94in a small town of Forks the head chief Charlie Swan just recently picked up his two best friends Harry Clearwater and Billy Black in his brand-new hummer trunk that was a birthday present from his nephew Jayden as he was too excited to drive his new trunk since Charlie called his two best friends stating their going to go fishing to kill time until they pick up Mia, Jay, Ariel and their families with their friends arriving at the airport.Charlie\'s P.O.V."Morning Billy, morning Harry," I greeted my two best friends as Harry helped Billy inside my hummer trunk along with my help noticing Jake wasn\'t joining us "Where\'s Jake I thought he was coming along," he explained."He was but, I decided to let him sleep he didn\'t get home until\xe2\x80\xa6 4 in the morning," Billy sighed at this "I had a feeling Sam and the pack were in double patrols again," he explained."That\'s not good," I frowned at this "How long has this been going on?" he asked."Since we heard about Victoria creating her army last year," Harry pointed out "Leah and Seth are in the same way too they haven\'t been getting enough sleep because of it," he explained."I thought they took care of Victoria and her army last year and won?" I asked pretending I didn\'t know about it."They did but, then Jake found out about\xe2\x80\xa6 Bella getting married to Edward,""SHE\'S WHAT?!"Billy and Harry widen their eyes "You mean you don\'t know,""No, no I didn\'t know that," I scowled "Son of a bitch\xe2\x80\xa6 but, I did hear about it from Phil\xe2\x80\xa6 I thought he was joking\xe2\x80\xa6""You mean Edward never\xe2\x80\xa6 asked you for your daughter\'s hand in marriage," Billy scowled "I knew I never liked that kid and how\'s Phil?""No\xe2\x80\xa6 no he never did\xe2\x80\xa6and Phil\'s good apparently Renee\'s pregnant" I stiffly replied."Are you\xe2\x80\xa6 okay?" Harry asked."Yeah I\'m fine I\'m happy for her \xe2\x80\xa6 she did says she always a big family\xe2\x80\xa6 so I\'m happy for her,""That\'s great Charlie\xe2\x80\xa6 but, I still can\'t believe he didn\'t ask you?""Nope didn\'t say one word to me .. not even when they left to see Renee\xe2\x80\xa6""Well\xe2\x80\xa6 isn\'t this a big twist," Harry sighed "Do you think Renee knows?""I don\'t know\xe2\x80\xa6" I grumbled under his breath."I\'m sorry Charlie\xe2\x80\xa6" Billy gave a comfort hand on my shoulder "If anything\xe2\x80\xa6 you still have us you know that don\'t you\xe2\x80\xa6" he explained."Thanks...Billy I appreciate that," Charlie murmured."You know if she \xe2\x80\xa6 becomes a vampire\xe2\x80\xa6 it would be treason right\xe2\x80\xa6?" Harry murmured causing the air more tense then usual.I held my breath nodding at this "I realize that\xe2\x80\xa6 I don\'t know what to do \xe2\x80\xa6 how to fix that\xe2\x80\xa6""You don\'t have to fix anything Charlie this is all Bella clearly she doesn\'t care who she leaves behind she\'s too selfish for her own needs then to care about her family," Billy argued back.~*~End of Chapter Twenty~*~Whoooooooooooo that took longer than I realize and I noticed that the last four chapters was longer than the other chapters so I decided to rewrite that chapter before I update which won\'t be long though once I update the next four chapters that\'s when I\'ll rewrite and everything.

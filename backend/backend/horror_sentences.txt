Even in the daytime the house looked sinister.
The house was built of dark stone that had been stained darker in places by the rain.
The windows were broken and boarded up.
Rain dripping down from the gutters made the place seem miserable.
The house looked grey and gloomy.
The house looked abandoned and lifeless.
People said the house was haunted by the man who died there.
A tall hedge kept the house hidden from view.
A tall hedge and overgrown shrubs gave the garden a neglected appearance.
The house was poisonous and killed the leaves of the trees which touched its brick walls.
Her heart thudded louder and louder.
His skin crawled.
Tendrils of terror curled into his stomach.
Cold sweat trickled down my sides.
My scalp prickled and her breath stalled.
Fear clogged his throat.
Her pulse pounded in her ears.
Cold sweat glued the shirt to his back.
Chills chased up her spine.
A ball of terror formed in his stomach.
Her stomach knotted.
A weight seemed to press on my chest, robbing me of breath.
Fear clenched like a tight first around my chest.

Water drips from the ceiling.
The dentist's drill whines.
The knife scrapes on the whetstone.
A faraway siren wails.
The wall clock ticks.
A dog barks outside.
An owl hoots.
The door knob felt icy in my palm.
She fumbled in her bag for the keys.
The door's pink paint was flaking, revealing previous coats of crimson and black.
The knobs of the two doorbells were sticky with grime.
'Strictly No Entry. Danger Zone', the sign on the door warned.
The double door had cracked glass panels and chipped blue paint, plastered with notices for last year's special offers.
While he waited, steps shuffled inside, and then a key scraped in the lock.
The door swished open.
The door opened with a squeal.
The door whined inwards on its hinges.
The door rattled open.
Behind, her, the door snapped shut.
The door closed with a thud.
You awake suddenly, buried alive.
Last person alive hears knocking.
Her heart stopped. She didn't.
"What's for dinner?" "You are."
That door was just closed.
Awake , eyes open, can't move.
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Monday.
Staircase, no shoes, broken glass.
Just saw my reflection blink.
Alone in bed. Blanket shifts.
Wife screams, at her funeral.
You didn't kill that spider.
Dead man returned for revenge.
You swim. Shark swims faster.
Footprints stop outside your door.
Time machine damaged. Stranded forever.
It made his skin crawl. Away.

Pick up hitchhiker. Hook hand.
The alien egg is hatching.
12 missed calls from mom.
Scratching sounds under your bed.
For sale, old clothes. Bloodstains.
Eyes sewn shut. Mouth too.
Fog turns you inside-out.
Dolls aren't supposed to bleed.
Human slaves. Robot slaves. Human slaves.
Child under the car. Speed bump?
Shotgun wedding. Bride and groom killed.
Alone. Empty highway. Out of gas.
Volcano erupts. Fleeing, they become ash.
The Homecoming Queen never came home.
You die. No Heaven. No Hell.
Zombie bite. Only cure: Shoot yourself.
Driving alone. Feel hand on shoulder.
Scratching heard from inside the coffin.
They awaited sunrise. It never came.
Astronaut on space walk. Lifeline snaps.
Railway tracks. Foot caught. Train coming.
"Help me!" you cried. No answer.
Flat tire. Missed flight. Plane crash.
Spider eggs hatch. Under your skin.
Dark night. Flat tire. Wolf howls.
Twenty-four hours to live. Yesterday.
Bomb. "Cut red wire". Colorblind.
Floating above. Look down. Dead body.
Zombies attack. Have gun. Forgot bullets.
Buried on Monday. Died on Tuesday.
Bitten. Moan. Die. Rise. Moan. Brains.
Tombstone trembling. Cries coming from below.
Awake from dream. Living a nightmare.
The water rose above his mouth.
World ending. Rescue ship is late.
Last human kills all zombies. Dies.
Clothes left at edge of lake.
Surrounded by zombies. One bullet left.
Flash of lightning. Glimpse a figure.
Driving fast. Sign says: Bridge out.
Buried alive. Wake up. Not alone.
Drunk driver. Sickening thump. Mother screams.
What do you mean, "No parachutes."?
Russian Roulette…five clicks… "Your turn."
Door opens. Empty room. Hear footsteps.

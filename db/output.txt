I do not own Harry Potter or Alice in Wonderland Luna Lovegood was wandering the gardens of her great grandmother Alice Kingsleigh. Luna was wearing her specter-specs to find the elusive jarvey (1). "Oh! I am late! So very late," a voice yelled in the distance. Luna walked over to the yelling voice and found a white rabbit looking at its pocket watch. Luna giggled at the oddly dressed rabbit. The white rabbit looked up and saw Luna standing beside a dove shaped bush. The rabbit blinked before asking, "Alice?" Luna giggled and said, "No, that was my very much great grandmother. You must be the white rabbit. Will you help me find a jarvey?" The white rabbit blinked for a few seconds before saying, "I am sorry, but I must go." Luna sighed but smiled dreamily and said, "Well then next time you come here, bring your friends and we can have a tea party. Just tell Lori the thestral to find me, she likes the red lilies." The white rabbit smiled and agreed to the deal before hopping off to the rabbit hole. The rabbit waved good bye before jumping down the rabbit hole. Luna smiled before wandering off to the lilies to tell Lori of the white rabbit and then finding the jarvey. Jarvey- an overgrown ferret that is found in Britain, Ireland and North America.. Update : This is a JOKE FANFICTION. It is pretty stupid, I know that, it has no plot, no sense, no style, it is just a short, stupid idea that I wrote down- I KNOW it is positively CRAPPY! I just wanted to PUBLISH a JOKE, dammit! SO STOP FLAMING! I'm so happy I'll write you a story, humoristic of course... the title is : The true story of Snape's death. There is a part about Snape and a catterpillar referring to the fact that the actor lent his voice to one in Alice in Wonderland. Written by : wait a second... ummmmmmm... oh! Right : victoria gryffindor peverell. VGP for my lectors. Which you are, if you're reading this, which you are, etc... Fine. This might not be the best fic ever. But don't like : don't read. Snape walked quietly through the trees, crouching like a cat smelling for an enemy that would steal his prey. Eyebrows low and ears strained, he listened, then whispered : "Are you here, my love ?" A high– pitched gigglish and girly voice answered him : "I am here , over your head! The coast is clear, catch me!" A huge pink caterpillar was lounging on a branch a few feet higher. Huge in length– and width... She wobbled and fell in his outstretched, skinny and hesitant arms. She landed in a thud and splotch. Laying in a pool of splattered pink and slightly green blood, lay Severus Snape, first class idiot, always remembered. Rest In Chaos may he. We will always hate you. I told you that Snotty Voldy didn't kill him with that weird stick!... Come to think of it, I'd rather be killed by a hair-looking green thing springing out of a wizzo's stick (who doesn't even have the fogging decency of having a nose, I mean really...) (the wizzo, not the stick, I mean) than by a fat, pink, giggling, thudding and splotching caterpillar. And no, she was not named Hermione. Sorry.. Disclaimer: All rights belong to J.K.

Warnings: slash, meaning boyxboy, gender bent characters, OOC-ness Into the Dark Depths Harry closed his eyes, bracing himself for the impact when Dudley and his gang chucked him into the lake. They really did a number on him this time; he couldn't move a single part of his body without grimacing in pain. He should really try to get himself out before he drowned. He couldn't see a thing, his glasses snapped cruelly and tossed away sometime ago. He blinked languidly, oddly calm. His fingers twitched. Was this how he was going to die? Harry coughed, sending a burst of bubbles from his mouth, wasting precious air. No, he hadn't made any happy memories! He didn't find the light that would outshine the darkness in his life yet! A few tears slipped from his eyes. I don't want to die. "Your majesty!" He didn't look up from the deck of cards on the table. Instead, he flipped one over lazily, smirking slightly at the King of Hearts. How ironic. "What is it," he demanded, voice low and cold in his callous indifference. "Th-the-there was an injured boy found in front of the castle, sir!" A fine eyebrow was raised. "Hmm? Interesting," red eyes sharpened, sending shivers down the guard's spine when he caught sight of them before jerkily lowering his head. "He is currently resting in the hospital wing." "I guess I just have to pay a visit to our 'guest.' Is that all?" "Yes, sir!" "Dismissed," he said, gracefully taking a sip from his teacup before setting it down with a soft clank. After giving a curt bow, the guard quickly left, pitying the young boy that would have a personal visit from the Red King. I will be using some bits from the Lewis Carroll, Disney, and Tim Burton versions of Alice in Wonderland in this story. I have a feeling craziness will ensue in this crossover. - Aldira. These are just a bunch of series of random drabbles/One-shots that I either wrote on the spot of had for a long time, like this one...to help kink out my writer's block... Enjoy. Ten: Hermione walked in the woods that were behind the borrow, arms wrapped around herself. She was fuming, angry at Ron, angry at herself for falling for him when he just wasn't intrested. She was wiping away tears when she saw it. A white rabbit in a waist coat. Shaking her head at the nonsense of it all, she followed it. She followed it all the way to the tree trunk, and down the rabbit hole. She was in a different world, one you could only dream of. "Hello there." She blinked and saw a man with crazy orange hair and a worn out hat. "I'm the Hatter." "Hermione." She replied as he lead her to the make-shift table. He pulled out a chair for her. "Come, come. Sit down and we'll have tea." He pour her a cup, laughing insanely to himeself. "You look like you need it." "Thank you," She replied softly, as he pushed in the seat for her. "I'm sorry to be barging into your tea party like this?" "Like what?" The Hatter asked, taking his seat at the head of the table, next to her. "I look like a right mess." She replied, wiping her cheeks of the remaining tears as he placed a small cake in front of her. He automatically dropped two sugars and only a small amount of milk, like she liked in her tea, without asking her. "Better then being in the wrong kind of mess." He smiled. "I enjoy meeting new people at my parties. They're always such a blast." He winked. " What brings you here?" "The rabbit..." Hermione replied, sipping her tea. "I followed him down the rabbit hole." "Now why would you do a thing like that?" "Just mad I guess." Hermione winced, she wasn't thinking that what she said would offend the Hatter, she knew of him from stories from a children's book. But she didn't know how he would act. "Why aren't we all?" He laughed, pouring himself a cup of tea.. Once Alice landed she realized that the White Rabbit was staring at her the whole time. He started to shout once again, "Oh dear, oh dear, I'm late, I'm late!" She saw the rabbit fly and started to have second thoughts about him. He was actually an owl named, Hedwig. Alice followed the owl all the way until she heard cheers. Once she went in the-what-she–thinks-is-a-castle, she saw that the owl landed by its owner, Hagrid. At the time, a boy is sitting in a chair with a talking hat on his head. Soon the hat says, "Gryffindor!" Everyone shouted while Alice was in confusion. Alice walked up next and sat in the chair, while a long-gray-haired-bearded guy places the hat on her head. His name was Professor Albus Dumbledore. The hat said, 'Gryffindor," but Alice shouts with confusion in her voice. She sat down next to the boy who got up before her. He introduced himself as if he had "100% self-esteem," and said, "Hi, my name is Harry Potter and this is my best friend, Ronald Weasley… call him Ron for short." After they met, Harry told her everything that is going on and every spell that he knew. Once Dumbledore dismissed the students to their houses Hagrid called Ron, Harry, and Alice to come by him so that he can tell him something. Hagrid whispered, "I have a vision that one day they will be the most powerful wizards of Hogwarts! I trust you with my prized possession, Hedwig!" Alice interrupted loudly, "What is Hogwarts?" The other students turned around, stared at Alice, and then gasped in shock… all except one, Neville Longbottom, stuck in confusion just like Alice was. Hagrid shouted, "Students return to your houses." The three went to their houses with the owl given by Professor Hagrid. Later that day, the students came to a feast where they were treated to dinner. They all received fish. Alice was reminded of her cat Dinah and daydreamed about her, but when she turned back to reality, the group of three received a letter from a mysterious place called The Capitol of Panem.. Title: Why Is A Raven Like A Writing Desk? Characters: Alice Longbottom, Alice Kingsley, Frank Longbottom, and the Mad Hatter. Notes: So, why is a raven like a writing desk? In some obsure way, Alice Longbottom attempts to figure it out. Cross-over, and of course, I own none of it! I hope you enjoy! Alice had always felt like she was in Wonderland. Hogwarts had that sort of feeling - it was beautiful, no doubt, but strange and mysterious and a little bit... mad. Lily was her Red Queen - beautiful, fiery, intelligent and insane - and James was her Red King - charming, funny, loyal and loopy. Her Tweedledum and Tweedledee were Marlene McKinnon and Dorcas Meadowes- both lovely in their own right, cute, and a comedy act to be forever upheld - and Sirius was her Cheshire Cat - gorgeous, smiley, cunning and crazy. Remus was her White Rabbit - forever running late, resourceful, bright and barmy - and Peter was Humpty Dumpty - proud, easily-offended, dim-witted and daft. Emmeline Vance was her White Queen - gentle, pale, finicky and foolish, and her White King was Benjy Fenwick - lovely, easy-going, noble and nuts. Frank was her Mad Hatter - handsome, kind, brave and off his head. Hogwarts was her Wonderland - strange and fascinating and just so slightly out of reach, almost like a dream. They could contradict her, berate her, tell her to stop her obsession over Muggle literature, but she wouldn't listen. She reckoned that a raven was like a writing desk, because it wasn't at all. And because neither were like the other, therefore, they were alike. At least, that was her theory. In theory, though, she was a pureblood engaged to a pureblood before she had even left school. In reality, the good little blood traitor girl who was friends with a Muggleborn and fought for house elf rights and was engaged to the man she loved at a time where sides had to be fought for and fought on. Even Wonderland had good and evil. And who cared if she was pureblood? It meant nothing, nothing, next to the world she had come to know outside of traditions and expectations. And she was Alice, so maybe she was a little bit mad anyway.. A/N: Hi everyone, I'm back from the dead~! Did you miss me? Okay. Anyway, hi this is really short, I totally rushed it, I only wrote this to signify that I'm alive anyway, so uh. Lol. Will I continue this? Maybe. I dunno. Is this OOC? I haven't read Harry Potter in a long time. Oh, and I tried making it not black and white okay, I really did. And I can't help but switch from past to present tense I don't even know okay I'll shut up now. Enjoy? :( Disclaimer: I don't know how to create perf characters like what JKR does, and I stole the title from the book by Peter Abrahams~ One day, I woke up, expecting to find Granger beside me, as she should be. However, the only visible thing on my right was a book. It was a very strange book: the cover was completely black, and no words or pictures were emblazoned on it. The spine and back were rather empty, as well. This would peak any sane person's interest, and I, for one, am a very sane person myself, and so I opened the book. The inside no different from the outside—the pages were totally blank. I examined it a little bit more, and all of a sudden, I felt like I was falling down into nothingness, and everything went dark. When I came to, I was still falling…rather, floating down into whatever was down there. Fortunately enough, I could see much clearly now. As I fell, random objects just kept appearing out of nowhere. Teapots, cups, chairs, tables—you name it. I am a wizard, and I see magic going on every day, but I still found this rather strange. After all, I've never come across a book that just makes you suddenly…hell, I can't even explain it. It was then that I noticed that I wasn't in my pyjamas anymore (Yes, Draco Malfoy wears pyjamas until now, shut up). I was in some kind of shirt and pants and a coat and I had a bloody bow tied around my neck. I even had this gigantic hat on my head. I have no idea what's happening. Before I knew it, the falling stopped, and I was standing in some kind of corridor or something. The corridor was sort of one way, but at some point, I got stuck. There was a fork. To make things easier for me though, I just took the one with the door, and I opened it. Beyond it was another, smaller door, which I opened. A door was behind this one. I opened it. Another door. Why am I not surprised. This continued on until the door was so small that I had to crawl to go past it. Why must life be so difficult? I found myself in a room so empty except for tiny curtains in the wall across from me, which I guess, have a tiny door behind it. It was far too tiny for me to fit in, though. Okay, so that wasn't the only thing in the room. Beside the curtains was Granger, who had weird clothes on like I did. She was wearing some kind of blue dress with an apron on top of it. She had a black headband with a ribbon on her head. Granger. With a ribbon on her head. Could this day get any weirder? She looked so amused to see me all confused. It was annoying. "So, Granger," I said, breaking the silence. "Care to explain?" She merely smiled.. Title:Theme 12: InsanityRating: KPairing: Pre-Hatter/Harry Warning: Nothing really.Disclaimer: I don't own Harry Potter or Alice in Wonderland (The 2010 movie).Summery: While on a business trip with his family, Harry falls down a hole and ends up in a strange place with even stranger people. Theme 12: Insanity Harry was excited. He had never been to the countryside like this before; heck, he had never been farther than the park and he never got to go on trips with family before. He was so happy and even Dudley kicking or punching him the entire trip didn't bring him down. Never before had he been allowed to roam the country side to his pleasure, which he did not knowing that the his relatives were half hoping he would get lost and never show up again. He was running through the woods and just enjoying the fresh air, his attention on the life around him and not on the ground to see where he was running. Because of that mistake, Harry tripped and fell down a rather large rabbit hole. Letting out a yell, Harry closed his eyes and waved his arms rapidly praying to grab something that will stop his fall when suddenly he suddenly jerked to a stop. Peeking slowly, he found himself…floating? Gasping in surprise, Harry was suddenly dropped, landing on his feet a bit unsteadily. Still reeling from the shock of what he didn't understand was accidental magic, the young boy didn't notice when a strange man wearing a stranger hat was suddenly in the room with him. "Well, hello!" A cheerful voice suddenly called out, making Harry whip around suddenly in alarm. "Welcome to the Underland! How nice to have guests!" "Underland?" Harry reapeated curiously, his head tilting slightly. "Just how did I get here?" "Well little one, I imagine that you fell down that hole as, well, Underland is just that: Under!" The strange man with bright red hair and pale skin grinned at him. "You mean I'm somewhere under the ground? How do I get out?" The boy asked, thinking of his family who would be very steamed if they had to wait around for him. But you haven't even been yet! Come, come see the sights before you go! Because after all, you need to have been somewhere before you can leave! And oh what sights you can see!" The stranger held his hand out to the young boy, grinning toothily. Harry was very wary, he had heard his Aunt Petunia often tell his cousin not to trust strangers or go with them although she had never said anything of the like to him. Taking the man's hand, Harry gave a small smile which was returned. The strange man led him out of the room and into a open space which was filled with huge fauna that made Harry gasp with awe. "This is amazing! This isn't Underland, this is Wonderland!" The raven haired blurted out, much to the other man's amusement. Wonderland…Well, that sure does have a nice ring to it." A fondness filled the man's tone as he squeezed Harry's hand slightly. All day Harry played with his new friends in what he had named as "Wonderland" soon enough though, he was forced to leave and cried and said goodbye to his friends. "We'll be here waiting Harry." The Mad Hatter said, pressing a kiss to the top of the boy's head. "Whenever you need a bit of madness in your life, we'll be here waiting." And Harry left and for many, many long years he remained unfortunately sane while the people who lived Under waited, never bored and always mad. The first moment Harry got to finally get away from everything, he went back to that forest in the countryside and down the rabbit hole where he was welcomed with open arms by the mad man he hadn't seen in years. He was home. Owari. Severus Snape had not expected this outcome. He had expected to be eaten. He had expected to be killed. He had expected to be tortured, then killed. He had expected to be stuffed in a cell for the rest of his life. He had expected to be stuffed in a cell for the rest of his life until he died by starvation and insanity. He had expected to be bitten by a large snake. He had expected anything but this. The Dark Lord had indeed set Nagini on him. He had died. He had never believed in a sort of afterlife; he simply expected to float in blackness forever, although a little part of him in the back of his mind hoped that he would be able to see Lily again. . somewhere, as long as he did. However, he did not float in blackness forever nor did he see Lily. He woke up next to a man with black and red armor and waves of shoulder length, pitch black hair. . and a black, heart-shaped eyepatch. Next to that man was a woman. She was a small woman, and the biggest part of her had to be her head, which was positively gargantuan. It was like a balloon. It looked as if you poked it, it would blow up in your face, splattering brain matter and various bits of goo and liquid all over you- You understand the point. Although both were rather handsome, even if her head was large and he was very, very tall and very, very . . different-looking. For a bare moment the man reminded him of himself, although probably much handsomer and less sarcastic and slightly more unnerving. She had very small hands and long, thin arms and a very fluffy gold, black and red dress that flared out at the waist. He had the idea that she had boots on, even though her legs were curled up underneath her. She looked very pathetic and sad, her mass of red curls slightly undone from the heart shape on her head. They were also holding hands. Or, more like, they were holding hands, but he seemed very reluctant to and was attempting to pull away slightly, but she kept holding on and increasing her grip. Severus could tell. He groaned when he awoke, and sat up immediately. He was still robed, but the marks on his neck were gone. "STAYNE! He's awake!" she shrieked, reminding him awfully of Bellatrix. However, her voice was hoarse and just as sad as the look on her face and he had the idea that she was attempting to act like everything was perfectly fine. "I see that, your Majesty," he said dryly, glancing at Severus. He was in a desert. Or more like a barren land. The ground was grey and wide and cracked and it was very cold and it was most definitely not the Shrieking Shack. He opened his mouth and a rasping noise escaped. He grimaced, swallowed, and tried again. "Who are you?" It was a good try. The woman sniffed haughtily, although it didn't work to be arrogant as tears were streaked down her face and were still leaking from the corners of her eyes. "I am The Red Queen, peasant," she said, "And this is My Knave of Hearts," she motioned to the man behind her. The man's lips quirked up at the corners at the name that seemed to be slightly fondly and slightly possessively said, but as soon it was there it was gone again. The 'my' in her words was louder than the rest, enunciated with a glare as if she was warning him to stay away from 'her' Knave of Hearts. They did not seem harmless. And then he noticed something; the chain binding them together. It was lengthy, about thirty feet, allowing them to walk a lengthy few steps away from eachother, but it was tight and heavy, he could tell. "Where am I?" The woman pouted, her heart-shaped .. and painted lips curving into a frown as she lowered her head. "You're in the Outlands," she said grimly. He knew, suddenly, that he was nowhere near the Shrieking Shack anymore. The only thing to do that seemed best to him at the current moment was to groan and hit his head against the tree behind him. However, it was soon discovered that it was not a good idea at all as a sharp pain shot throughout his head. He sighed loudly. A thought occurred to him - his wand. His wand - where was his wand? He groped for it frantically, and a huge sense of relief hit him when he encountered it. He drew it out. It was in perfect condition. He looked at the two, who looked as confused as he felt. The female- the Queen - was thin. That much was obvious underneath the tight bodice of the dress she wore. It was a beautiful dress. He blinked, wondering where that thought had come from. He pushed it out of the way and flicked his wand; before them appeared silver platters of the richest food. Then he groaned to himself again. When had he become so giving? There was a moment of silence, and they looked more shocked than they had been before. Then, the Red Queen dived- quite literally, DIVED - at the plate and began shoving food into her face. Neither of them noticed when he disapparated. - and stayed dead. There was indeed an afterlife. He had found it - but for some reason, Severus Snape could not forget The Red Queen and The Knave of Hearts.. This is my first story and leave your comments! I'd love to hear them! I do not own these characters! I owe the pleasure of the creation of the characters to J.K Rowling and Lewis Carroll. Down the Other Hole Chapter 1 "RON!" Hermione screamed as she ran down the hill towards the Whomping Willow, Harry slightly behind her. Ron was chasing Crookshanks after she took his homework. Then he saw her run down the hole in the Whomping Willow. He knew the hole went to the Shrieking Shack so he slid down the hole. Suddenly he was falling down a tunnel that never seemed to end. He looked around and saw pianos and tables falling around him. He wondered what kind of dark magic this was. Slightly behind him was Hermione. She also looked around in confusion but was screaming at the top of her lungs. She saw Ron ahead of her and Harry behind her. She screamed louder as a piano almost hit her in the head. She didn't know what was going on. Last was Harry. He had seen something like this before. It was on…. on… the crystal ball! He slightly missed a chair that slid right by his foot. He looked down at Hermione who was screaming as loud as she could. Ron looked down and saw a floor with a black and white pattern. The ground was getting closer and closer. He landed on the ground with a thump. About 5 seconds later Hermione landed on top of him and then soon after, Harry. He looked around and didn't see Crookshanks anywhere. All he saw was a table with a small bottle that said "Drink Me".Chapter 2 When the other two climbed off Ron he stood up and looked around the room. When he looked back at Harry and Hermione they were both looking at the bottle. They looked at each other and grabbed for the bottle. Hermione grabbed it. Then Harry yelled "Accio bottle"! He grabbed it and looked at the bottle. Harry then realized there was enough for all of them. He shared his idea. They all agreed. Ron grabbed a key that was on the table. Then he took a sip as the other two did. He felt this weird tingling. Suddenly the table started growing bigger. His clothes were also getting better. He then realized he had just shrunk! Then he looked over and so had Hermione and Harry! As he struggled out of the mountain of his clothes he looked around for a way to escape this weird world. He looked and saw a door. It was very tiny and the key looked like it just fit the lock. He turned the key and the door opened. He walked through the door and saw a strange world with millions of plants and flowers…with faces! He looked around and saw a rabbit. Hermione went over and looked at the rabbit. It was very peculiar. He had a suit on and he had a pocket watch. Hermione said in baby talk, Awwww… Look at the little bunny. She nearly jumped out of her skin when it talked. He said "I'm late for tea, I'm late for tea." He ran as fast as he could in the opposite direction. They apparated a few minutes ahead of where they were and waited for the rabbit. As he came up to them he slowed down and asked where they were from. They told him Hogwarts. He sighed and said "Follow me" Apparently someone had been there before.Chapter 3 They followed him to a long table with a tea set and cookies all across the table. There at the end sat a strange man. He had red hair and a crazed look in his eye. He had an uneven hat on which had the fraction 10/6. He looked at them for a minute and yelled "happy unbirthday!" Ron wondered if someone had been here before. They sure knew what Hogwarts was. Then he slowly asked if someone had been here before from Hogwarts. They nodded their heads yes. Do you know their name? When they nodded their heads yes Hermione knew exactly who had come last. "There were two people at different times weren't there?" They nodded at her. She looked at Ron I know one I'm not positive about the other, but I know Draco has been down here. Harry understood. Then he said "That's what Draco has been muttering about." He looked over to Hermione who had just said "The other one is Luna, right sir? She looked at the man questioningly. Oh, call Mad Hatter and do you mean Alice? "No, we mean Luna." Hermione said. The rabbit then whispered in the hatter's ear that Luna was the said Alice. Luna's still here right? "Yes" he said slowly. "Where is she" Harry quickly said. The hatter said she is…..The hatter said she was trying to kill a dragon like thing. Suddenly they heard a great roar and the hatter whispered "not the bandersnatch". Then he told them to shrink themselves down. They looked at each other and said at the same time "Reducio." They shrunk and the hatter grabbed them and put them on his hat. He said "hold on" and threw the hat. They landed near a castle. It was all white and tall columns reached up. At the entrance was a woman dressed in a white gown and had a pale complexion. She said "I am the White Queen. I have been expecting you." They looked at each other in confusion. Then she said "I suppose you have heard of my sister" She paused. "The red queen?" They looked at each other then nodded their heads no.
